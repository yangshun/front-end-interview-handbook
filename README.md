## What is this?

Unlike typical software engineer job interviews, front end job interviews have less emphasis on algorithms and have more questions on intricate knowledge and expertise about the domain — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, just to name a few areas. This repository covers all you need to know for front end interviews:

- [Various formats of Front end interviews](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/introduction/) including formats by different companies
- [Front end system design interviews](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/front-end-system-design/)
- [Front end trivia questions](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/trivia/) - answers to the h5bp Front-end Developer Interview Questions
- [Front end questions](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/coding/javascript-utility-function/) - JavaScript, DOM, algorithms, and more
- [Front end interview questions by companies](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/company-interview-questions/)
