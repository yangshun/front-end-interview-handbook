## Test cases

- Filtering
  - Text inputs
    - Enter some strings in lower case, check that results match the search string
    - Delete the entered values, check that the full results are displayed again
  - Range inputs
    - Enter only a min value, check that the results are all larger
    - Enter only a max value, check that the results are all smaller
    - Enter both min and max values, check that the results are within the min/max boundaries
- Ensure that all the existing features (pagination and sorting) still work as usual, with and without filters
- Test with housing data and check that the table can be rendered, pagination, sorting, and filtering functionality works correctly
