title: Data Table IV
excerpt: Build a generalized data table with pagination, sorting and filtering features
---

**Note:** This is a follow up to the [Data Table III](/questions/user-interface/data-table-iii) question, you should complete that question first before attempting this question.

In [Data Table III](/questions/user-interface/data-table-iii), we built a generalized data table that displays rows in a paginated format and allows for sorting rows by specific columns in both ascending and descending order. The `DataTable` component is not coupled to the data and can be used to render any type of data.

Extend the `DataTable` component to allow per-column filtering functionality.

## Requirements

- Each column can be configured to have a filter input within the header cell
- The filter input filters rows that match the value of the input
- Supported types of filters:
  - **Text search**: For string fields. Match data based on case-insensitive string comparisons
  - **Range search**: For numerical fields. To keep things simple, use two text fields, indicating the min/max values. Match if the value lies between the provided min/max value
- If any filter inputs are empty or invalid, they should be ignored
- Only rows that pass **all** the filter criteria present should remain

To assist in your testing, another table has been rendered using houses data (`src/data/houses.json`). Feel free to comment out any code while working on the question. You should test your final solution with both datasets to ensure that the component remains generalized and flexible.

**Hint**: Have a look at this [TanStack Table Column Filters example](https://tanstack.com/table/latest/docs/framework/react/examples/filters) if you need inspiration on designing an API for adding filters.

## Notes

The skeleton code uses the solution of [Data Table III](/questions/user-interface/data-table-iii), but you are free to use your own solution as a starting point.
