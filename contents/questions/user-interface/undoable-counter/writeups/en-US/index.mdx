Build a counter with a history of the changes and ability to undo/redo actions.

![Undoable Counter Example](/img/questions/undoable-counter/undoable-counter-example.png)

## Requirements

- The counter starts at 0.
- There buttons "/2", "-1", "+1", "x2" apply the respective operations to the current count.
  - A row is added to the history table, showing the operation, count before the operation, count after.
- The "Undo" button undoes the last action and updates the count.
- The "Redo" button applies the last undo-ed action, if any.
- Clicking on the modification buttons should clear any undo-ed actions and they cannot be redo-ed.
- The "Reset" button resets the counter to 0 and clears all history.
