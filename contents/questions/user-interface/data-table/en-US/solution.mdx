## Solution

Data tables are frequently asked during front end interviews as displaying paginated data with filtering functionality is a UI built at almost every company.

Since the table skeleton has been provided, we can focus on the state and data manipulation aspects of the data table.

### State

State is straightforward. Only two state values are needed, the current page and the page size. Since the data does not change in this case, there's no need for the users data to be part of state.

These state values are manipulated by the page size `<select>` and prev/next buttons.

The maximum number of pages can be derived from the number of users divided by the page size, hence it does not need to be part of state.

### Pagination

We implement a function `paginateUsers` that takes in the the list of users, the page number, and the page size. It will return the list of users for the current page and the total number of pages.

To determine the list of users for the current page, we can determine the start and end indices, then use `Array.prototype.slice()` to extract the appropriate slice out of the users list:

- **Start index**: Take the page number multiplied by the page size. Since the page numbers start from 1, we have to subtract 1 from the page number first. This value will the starting index of the users to be sliced.
- **End index**: Add the page size to the calculated start index. Since we'll be using `Array.prototype.slice()`, it doesn't matter if the end index exceeds the size of the list.

`paginateUsers()` will be called in the render path and the returned users `pageUsers` is the current page of users to be rendered. The rendering code doesn't need to be changed much.

### User experience

Some other user experience improvements we can make:

- Reset the page number to the first page when the page size changes. Otherwise it can be confusing when the user changes the page size and the current page exceeds the total pages and nothing is shown.
- Disable the Prev/Next buttons when it is not possible to navigate to the previous or next page.
