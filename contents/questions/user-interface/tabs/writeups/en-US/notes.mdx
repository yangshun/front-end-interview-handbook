## Accessibility

Accessibility is an important factor for making good Tabs components. The [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide for Tabs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/) has a long list of guidelines for the ARIA roles, states, and properties to add to the various elements of a Tab. [Tabs II](/questions/user-interface/tabs-ii) and [Tabs III](/questions/user-interface/tabs-iii) will focus on improving the accessibility of Tabs component.
