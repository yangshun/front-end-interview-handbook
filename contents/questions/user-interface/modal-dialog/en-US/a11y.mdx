## Accessibility

There are a lot of a11y considerations for modal dialogs, possibly too many to implement during interviews.

For your knowledge, here are some of the more important ones:

- ARIA attributes:
  - Use `role="dialog"` on the modal container.
  - Add `aria-modal="true"` to indicate that the modal is blocking interaction with the page content.
  - Use `aria-labelledby` to associate the modal's title with the dialog.
  - Use `aria-describedby` if there's additional descriptive text.
- Keyboard navigation:
  - Ensure the modal can be opened and closed using keyboard controls.
  - Provide a way to close the modal using the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key.
- Focus management:
  - Set focus to the first focusable element in the modal when it opens.
  - Trap focus within the modal when it's open, preventing users from tabbing outside the modal.
  - Return focus to the triggering element when the modal closes.

The subsequent questions will involve implementing these a11y considerations:

- [Modal Dialog II](/questions/user-interface/modal-dialog-ii): Adding ARIA attributes.
- [Modal Dialog III](/questions/user-interface/modal-dialog-iii): Adding keyboard navigation.
- [Modal Dialog IV](/questions/user-interface/modal-dialog-iv): Adding focus management.
