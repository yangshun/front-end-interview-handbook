        One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled
        dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into
        a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back,
        and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
        brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches
        into stiff sections.
      </ModalDialog>
    </div>
  );
}
