## Solution

Create a function to turn a DOM element into a progress bar. We then construct the necessary inner DOM elements and set the appropriate styling and add a label within to indicate the progress percentage.

Filling the bar proportionately to the progress (a number between 0-100, inclusive) can be accomplished using the `Element.style.width` property . Since the value is dynamic, we cannot possibly write classes for it beforehand and we have to use inline styles.

It's a good practice to expose a method to change the progress percentage in case as it is common for the progress changes with time. Its usage is shown with the progress slider at the bottom.
