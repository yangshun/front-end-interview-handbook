title: Progress Bar
excerpt: Build a progress bar component that shows the percentage completion of an operation
---

Implement a progress bar component which shows the completion progress by filling the bar proportionately to the progress (a number between 0-100, inclusive).

![Progress Bar Example](/img/questions/progress-bar/progress-bar-example.png)

## Requirements

- The filled bar can be of any color. The example uses `#c5c5c5` for the background color and `#0d6efd` for the progress color.
- The completion % is shown in the center of the filled bar.
