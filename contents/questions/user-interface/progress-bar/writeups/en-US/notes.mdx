## Notes

- `overflow: hidden` has to be added to `.progress-bar` because of the rounded corners, so that the filled progress doesn't stick out of the rounded corners.
- Progress values outside the range of [0, 100] should be handled well; they should not cause layout issues.
- For small values, there might not be enough space to display the percentage label. We can either not show anything or truncate the display.
- We can use CSS transforms (e.g. `scale`) as opposed to changing the `width` property, which is better for performance if there's a need for animation.

## Accessibility

- `role="progressbar"` and `aria` values are added to the component for a11y reasons, so that screen readers can accurately depict the component.
