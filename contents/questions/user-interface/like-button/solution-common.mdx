## Solution

The focus of this question is in the handling of the various states when there's a pending request.

### Data Model

We'll need a few state variables:

- `liked`: Tracks whether the button is in the default state or the liked state. Since there are only two states, we can use a boolean type to represent it.
- `isPending`: Determines if there's a pending background request.
- `errorMessage`: Error message obtained from the back end when the API request fails.

### Making Back End API Requests

Writing code to make back end requests is pretty standard, in general you should use the following flow:

1. Set the UI to show a loading state.
1. Clear the error message.
1. Make the back end request via `fetch`
1. Determine if the request has succeeded.
   1. If the response has succeeded, update the UI to indicate success.
   1. If the response has failed, update the UI to indicate failure by showing an error message.
1. Remove the loading state.

The above is captured in the `likeUnlikeAction` function.

### Rendering

The rendering code is pretty straightforward since there isn't much dependency among the state variables when rendering the UI.
