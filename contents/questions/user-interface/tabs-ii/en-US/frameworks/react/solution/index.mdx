## Solution

We'll build on top of [Tabs' solution](/questions/user-interface/tabs/react/solution). Other than adding the right ARIA roles and states, which is straightforward, we also need to link the tab items with the corresponding tabpanels. Hence we create two functions, `getTabListItemId` and `getTabPanelId` to do this.

- `getTabListItemId` generates a unique ID string to use as the value of the `id` attribute of tab items. This ID will be used as the value of the `aria-labelledby` attribute of the corresponding tabpanel.
- `getTabPanelId` generates a unique ID string to use as the value of the `id` attribute of tabpanels. This ID will be used as the value of the `aria-controls` attribute of the corresponding tab item.

Since there can be multiple `Tabs` component instances on the page and we cannot guarantee that the tab item values will be globally unique, each `Tabs` instance needs to have a unique identifier. The `useId` React hook can be used to generate unique ID for each `Tabs` instance. The final ID string will be a concatenation of the `Tabs` instance's ID, the item value, and whether it's a tab item or a tabpanel.
