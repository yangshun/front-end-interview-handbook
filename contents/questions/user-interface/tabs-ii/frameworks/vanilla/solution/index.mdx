## Solution

We'll build on top of [Tabs' solution](/questions/user-interface/tabs/vanilla/solution). Other than adding the right ARIA roles and states, which is straightforward, we also need to link the tab items with the corresponding tabpanels. Hence we create two functions, `getTabListItemId` and `getTabPanelId` to do this.

- `getTabListItemId` generates a unique ID string to use as the value of the `id` attribute of tab items. This ID will be used as the value of the `aria-labelledby` attribute of the corresponding tabpanel.
- `getTabPanelId` generates a unique ID string to use as the value of the `id` attribute of tabpanels. This ID will be used as the value of the `aria-controls` attribute of the corresponding tab item.

Since there can be multiple tabs component instances on the page and we cannot guarantee that the tab item values will be globally unique, each tabs instance needs to have a unique identifier. We can create a `newID` function that generates a unique ID which under the hood is a globally-incrementing integer. The final ID string will be a concatenation of the tab instance's ID, the item value, and whether it's a tab item or a tabpanel.
