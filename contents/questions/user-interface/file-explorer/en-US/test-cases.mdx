## Test cases

1. Rendering:
   - Verify that the component renders without errors
   - Check that all file and directory names are displayed correctly
   - Ensure directories are displayed before files
   - Confirm that items within each directory are sorted alphabetically
2. Directory expansion/collapse:
   - Test expanding a directory by clicking on it
   - Test collapsing an expanded directory by clicking on it again
   - Verify that the expand/collapse indicator changes appropriately
   - Test expanding/collapsing nested directories
3. Indentation:
   - Check that contents of directories are indented correctly
   - Verify that nested directories have appropriate levels of indentation
4. File interaction:
   - Confirm that files are not expandable or interactive
5. Empty directories:
   - Test rendering of empty directories
   - Verify that empty directories can still be expanded/collapsed
6. Sorting:
   - Confirm that directories appear before files in each level
   - Verify alphabetical sorting within directories and files separately
7. State persistence:
   - Check if expanded/collapsed state of directories persists when re-rendering
