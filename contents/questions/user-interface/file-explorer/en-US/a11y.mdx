## Accessibility

Accessibility is important for a good File Explorer component. The [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide for Tree View Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview) has a long list of guidelines for the ARIA roles, states, and properties to add to the various elements of a Tree View. We recommend working on [File Explorer II](/questions/user-interface/file-explorer-ii) and get to know about the accessibility criteria of a Tree View component.
