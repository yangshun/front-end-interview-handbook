Given an array of file objects, build a component that displays them in a hierarchical tree format.

There are two types of objects – files and directories:

1. Files are essentially leaf nodes of the tree, they do not have children.
2. Directories can contain other objects – either files or directories.

You may assume that the IDs and names within the same directory are unique.

## Requirements

- The names of the directories/files should be displayed.
- Directories
  - Contents of the directory should be displayed in a manner that indicates it belongs within the directory. The recommended approach is to indent the contents to the right.
  - Directories can be expanded and collapsed. Clicking on a directory should toggle its expanded/collapsed state.
  - Directories should appear before files. All the items should be sorted alphabetically within their respective categories.
  - You may style the expand/collapse functionality in a way you prefer as long as it is clear that the item is a directory and whether it is in the expanded or collapsed state.
  - Directories can be empty.
- Files
  - Files are not expandable and cannot be interacted with.
- The focus of the exercise is on the functionality and not the styling.

## Data format

```ts
interface FileObject {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  children?: FileObject[];
}
```

Example data:

```js
const fileData = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'README.md',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: 'Documents',
    children: [
      {
        id: 3,
        name: 'Word.doc',
      },
      {
        id: 4,
        name: 'Powerpoint.ppt',
      },
    ],
  },
];
```
