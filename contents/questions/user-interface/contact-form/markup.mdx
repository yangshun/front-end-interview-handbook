## Solution

This is a basic question which evaluates your knowledge of the web platform. Forms and form submissions can entirely be built without any JavaScript! As a Front End Engineer, it's important to know what the platform provides and not resort to JavaScript for everything.

The first thing we need to do is to wrap the fields in a `<form>`, which is already given in the template. To tell the `<form>` which URL to submit the data to, we use the `action` attribute with the API URL as the value. The API URL is expecting a HTTP POST request, hence we also use `method="post"` on the `<form>`.

Form fields with the `name` attribute will have the attribute value become the key in the form data. Hence we can add `name="name"`, `name="email"`, `name="message"` to the various form fields. Do also add `<label>`s to label your `<input>`s.

Lastly, submit buttons can be implemented in two ways:

1. `<button type="submit">`: By default, `<button>`s have `type="submit"` as default and when used in `<form>`s, will trigger a form submission.
1. `<input type="submit">`: The element will be rendered as a button and clicking the `<input>` will trigger a form submission.
