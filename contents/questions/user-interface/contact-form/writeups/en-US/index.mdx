title: Contact Form
excerpt: Build a contact form which submits user feedback and contact details to a back end API
---

Building forms is a common task in Front End. In this exercise, we will build a basic "Contact Us" form, commonly seen on marketing websites for visitors to ask questions or provide feedback.

## Requirements

- The form should contain the following elements:
  - Name field.
  - Email field.
  - Message field. Since the message can be long, a `<textarea>` will be more suitable.
  - Submit button
    - Contains the text "Send".
    - Clicking on the submit button submits the form.
- The form and submission should be implemented entirely in HTML. Do not use any JavaScript or framework-specific features for this question.
- There is no need to do any client-side validation on the fields. Validation will be done on the server side.

## Submission API

Upon submission, `POST` the form data to `https://questions.greatfrontend.com/api/questions/contact-form` with the following fields in the **request body**: `name`, `email`, `message`.

If all the form fields are correctly filled up, you will see an alert containing a success message. Congratulations!

## Notes

You do not need JavaScript for this question, the focus is on HTML form validation and submission.
