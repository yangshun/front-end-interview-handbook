## Solution

To add a new task, we need to enter text into the input field and click the 'Submit' button. Subsequently, the `addTask()` method is invoked. If the provided string is not empty, it adds that element to `tasks`. Once the task is added, we clear the `newTask` variable.

While displaying the list of tasks in the template, we also assign a button to them to remove the task by calling `deleteTask(task.id)`, which simply filters out the given task with the specified ID.

### State

- `id` - variable only for example id purpose. It is used to increment id in tasks to not get duplications
- `newTask` - name for newTask that is bound with input by using ngModel `[(ngModel)]="newTask"`.
- `tasks` - all of our tasks objects

### Models

```typescript
export interface Task {
  id: number;
  label: string;
}
```

### Angular Insights

- You can adopt a more advanced, reactive-like approach using RxJS (without using subscriptions as possible). However, if you opt for subscriptions, remember about destroying them to prevent memory leaks.

- You might create service for maintaining the state. Inject the service in smart component and crete dumb components that only display and interact with the UI and all events from dumb components are passed to the smart one.

- If you're confident with the latest Angular versions, consider using signals standalone API.

- You can try to focus more on keywords such as `readonly`, `private`, `public` and `void`.

- If you're creating a bigger application it would be good practice to use styles per component instead of putting all styles in one file.
