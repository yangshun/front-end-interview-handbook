## Solution

### State

We will need two state values: `tasks` and `newTask`.

`tasks`: Since there's a list of tasks that can be modified, we will need it to be part of the component's state. When rendering a list of elements in React, we need to specify a `key` for each item. We cannot use the text of the task as the `key` because they are not guaranteed to be unique. It is typically a bad practice to use array `index` as `key`s, but for this question, it is acceptable. The most foolproof method is to generate a unique ID for each task. Libraries like [`uuid`](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid) come to mind, but in this case, a simple incrementing counter will do. Since we want `id`s to be globally unique, it is initialized in the module scope, outside of the component.

`newTask`: state to represent the new task input field, although that is not strictly necessary if we prefer [uncontrolled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html). However, it is generally more common to make `input` fields controlled, aka backed by component state. The initial value for this state should not be `null` as React will show a warning otherwise.

### Adding tasks

New tasks should be added to the end of the `tasks` array. We can construct a new task object with a new `id` and the `label` field, based on the `newTask` value, create a **new list** from the previous list with the new item, and set it as the new `tasks` state.

### Deleting tasks

Having a unique `id` for each task object simplifies things here because we can filter the existing list and exclude the task corresponding to the `id` to be removed. If you opted to use array index instead of generating unique IDs, you can use `Array.prototype.splice` to remove elements at that index.

## Notes

Using React, the user input will be automatically escaped so there's no need to manually prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS).
