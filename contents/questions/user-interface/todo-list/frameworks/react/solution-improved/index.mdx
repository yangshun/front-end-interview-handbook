This is an improved version of the [basic solution](/questions/user-interface/todo-list/react/solution).

Some of the improvements:

- Encapsulating the ID generator so that it can only be read from but not modified from external sources.
- Use a `<form>` to capture submission of new tasks. This will handle both <kbd>Enter</kbd> keys and "Submit" button clicks.
- Prevents empty input values from being added to the list.
- Trims the input value before adding to the list.
- Displays an empty state when there are no tasks in the list.
- Asks for confirmation before deletion of a task.
