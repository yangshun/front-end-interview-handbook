<Solution />

In this approach, `<template>`s are used for rendering both initial and new tasks. You might have realized that you have the task markup duplicated in two places: the initially-rendered tasks and new tasks.

It is a chore to make the markup consistent for both initial and new tasks. Using a `<template>` element will make it easy to render both the initial task and newly-added tasks.

This solution also contains some UX improvements:

- Use a `<form>` to capture submission of new tasks. This will handle both <kbd>Enter</kbd> keys and "Submit" button clicks.
- Prevents empty input values from being added to the list.
  - Useful for preventing accidental additions.
- Trims the input value before adding to the list.
- Asks for confirmation before deletion of a task.
  - Destructive actions should always require double confirmation in case the user accidentally pressed the delete button.
