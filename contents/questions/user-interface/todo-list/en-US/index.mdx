title: Todo List
excerpt: Build a Todo list that lets users add new tasks and delete existing tasks
---

You're given some existing HTML for a Todo List app. Add the following functionality to the app:

1. Add new tasks on clicking the "Submit" button.
   - The `<input>` field should be cleared upon successful addition.
1. Remove tasks from the Todo List upon clicking the "Delete" button.

## Notes

- The focus of this question is on functionality, not the styling. There's no need to write any custom CSS.
- You may modify the markup (e.g. adding `id`s, data attributes, replacing some tags, etc), but the result should remain the same visually.
- You may want to think about ways to improve the user experience of the application and implement them (you get bonus credit for doing that during interviews).
