## Accessibility

- All form `<input>`s should be labelled either via `<label>`s or `aria-label` attributes. Since the original markup doesn't contain a `<label>`, we can add `aria-label` to the `<input>`.
- For screen reader users, they won't be aware that a new task has been added. An `aria-live` region can be added to inform about the newly-added task. There is unlikely enough time to do this during an interview but you will get bonus points for mentioning it.
