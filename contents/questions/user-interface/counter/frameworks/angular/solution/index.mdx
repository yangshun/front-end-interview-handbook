## Solution

This is a short question which only requires one state variable, which is the number of times the button has been clicked (`count`).

Declare `count` as an instance variable and create a method `increment` that increments the `count`. This method is bound to the `<button>`'s click action and will be called when the `<button>` is clicked.
