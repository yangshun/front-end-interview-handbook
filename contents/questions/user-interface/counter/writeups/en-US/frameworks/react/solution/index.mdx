This is a short question which only requires one state variable, which is the number of times the button has been clicked (`count`).

`useState` can be used to track that variable and replace the hardcoded 0 with the `count` state. Then attach an `onClick` handler on the `<button>` element and increment the `count` whenever it is clicked.
