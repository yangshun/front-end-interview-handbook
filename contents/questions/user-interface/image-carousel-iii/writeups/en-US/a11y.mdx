## Accessibility

- All images should have `alt` text that describes the image to support accessibility. It will be read out loud by screen readers and is also used by search engines.
- Add appropriate `aria-label`s to the buttons since the buttons do not have visible labels.
- **[Not implemented]**: Add a screen-reader-only element with the `aria-live="polite"` attribute and `alt` text of the new image as contents. This instructs screen readers to announce that a new image is displayed.
