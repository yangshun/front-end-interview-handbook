title: Data Table II
excerpt: Build a users data table with sorting features

**Note:** This is a follow up to the [Data Table](/questions/user-interface/data-table) question, you should complete that question first before attempting this question.

In [Data Table](/questions/user-interface/data-table), we built a users data table that displays users in a paginated format. Data tables often allow sorting rows by specific columns in both ascending and descending order.

## Requirements

- Allow sorting by a specific column by clicking on the table header. The data will be sorted by the selected column in ascending order (default).
- Clicking on the header of the table that is already sorted by that column will toggle the sorting order between ascending and descending.

## Notes

The skeleton code uses the solution of [Data Table](/questions/user-interface/data-table), but you are free to use your own solution as a starting point.
