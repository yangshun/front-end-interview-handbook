## Accessibility

- `<input type="checkbox">` are paired with `<label>`s. Clicking on labels also selects/deselect the item.
- Since the `<button>`s do not have a visible label, use `aria-label`s to indicate their purpose. As a result, make the button contents hidden from screen readers via `aria-hidden="true"`.
- All required functionality should be achievable just by using the keyboard.
