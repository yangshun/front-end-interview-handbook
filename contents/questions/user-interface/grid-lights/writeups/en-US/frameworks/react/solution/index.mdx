## Solution

The question can be split into two parts: (1) Rendering, (2) State, and (3) Deactivation.

### Rendering

Since we're required to render a 3x3 grid of cells, CSS Grid is literally the best tool for the job. We can definitely use other approaches but CSS Grid is a forward-looking technology we should master. If you're unfamiliar with CSS Grids, [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) is an interactive game for you to learn about it.

The following CSS will render a 3x3 grid with 20px of padding and spacing between the cells.

```css
.grid {
  --spacing: 20px;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  padding: var(--spacing);
  gap: var(--spacing);
}
```

To create cells that are perfect squares, we can set the height of the cells to be 0 and make one of the vertical paddings 100% (`padding-bottom: 100%`), which sets the total height of the cell to be the same as the width.

Remember that we have an odd requirement of the middle cell to be omitted? We can create a declarative and flexible rendering approach where we define a 2D array of 1s and 0s (`config`) and the grid will be rendered according to the configuration. Because of this, we have to define the `grid-template-columns` as an inline style that uses the `config`'s number of columns when rendering the CSS grid.

Activating/deactivating the cells can be done by adding a new class for the activated state which adds `background-color: green` and toggling that class.

### State

Only one state is needed, `order`, which is the order that the cells were clicked. Assuming we flatten the 2D `config` array into a single dimension, each cell will correspond to an index. We can store this list of indices in the `order` array, adding to it when a cell is clicked.

Whether the cell is lit up can be determined by whether the cell's index exists in the `order` array.

### Deactivation

Deactivation happens when all the cells have been activated. We know this has happened by comparing the number of items in the `order` array vs the number of 1s in the `config`; when they are the same, we can start deactivating the cells.

We can use `setInterval` with a duration of 300ms and remove the last value of the `order` array by using `order.pop()` each time the interval callback is invoked. Note that we need to use the callback form of `setOrder`, which receives the updated `order` value as the parameter. This is necessary because the `setInterval` callback's closure will be referencing a stale version of `order` and the callback form of `setOrder` will provide us with the most updated `order` value.

In idiomatic React, we avoid mutation as much as possible, so we make a copy of the `order` array first before calling `pop()` on it to remove the last item.

When the `order` array is empty, we can clear the interval timer.
