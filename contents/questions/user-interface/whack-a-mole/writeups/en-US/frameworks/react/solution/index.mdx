## Solution

### Props

The default whack-a-mole game shown in the diagram is 3 x 3 with predefined durations for the round and how long the mole appears for. In order to make the game customizable, we can introduce the following props:

- `rows`: Number of rows.
- `cols`: Number of columns.
- `roundDuration`: How long the round lasts.
- `molesAtOnce`: How many moles appear at once. In arcades, there could be multiple moles appearing at the same time for increased difficulty levels.
- `molesAppearingInterval`: How long the moles show up for.

### State

The game board can be represented as a one-dimensional array of indices. On a 3 x 3 board, the array has a length of 9 and index 3 will correspond to row 2 column 1.

- `visible`: A set of indices determining the positions of the visible moles. This is generated every `molesAppearingInterval`.
- `score`: Current score.
- `running`: Whether the game is in progress.
- `timeLeft`: Time left for the current round, in seconds.

### Rendering

CSS grid is used to render the cells in a 2-dimensional format. It's a great choice because you can render the cells as a single list of DOM elements but with the right CSS grid settings, they can be displayed in a `rows` x `cols` layout.

### Generating Moles

Every `molesAppearingInterval`, regardless of how many moles are visible on the page, we should generate positions for the next set of `molesAtOnce` moles. We can can randomly generate indices `molesAtOnce` times, but when `molesAtOnce` > 1, there's a slim chance that that the generated indices are repeated and you need to randomly generate again.

An elegant way to generate unique indices is to create an array of indices, shuffling the array, and taking the first `molesAtOnce` values. It requires O(N) space but this approach is arguably simpler to understand and implement correctly.

When using `setInterval` within React components, an extremely common source of bugs is accessing stale prop/state values. Hence the dependent variables are used in the `useEffect` dependency array to re-run the intervals when dependent variables are updated.

### `startGame`

This function is called at the start of a new round and a countdown timer is started. It starts an interval timer that runs every second, decrementing the `currTimeLeft` by 1 every second until `currTimeLeft` reaches 0.

Note that the timer should also be cleared upon unmounting, hence we can assign the timerId to a `countdownTimerId` ref and clear it when the component unmounts. Otherwise the timer could be still running and attempting to update component state even when the component is no longer on-screen.

### `whackMole`

This function removes indices from the `visible` set when the correct cells are clicked, if they are present in the set, and increments the score by 1.
