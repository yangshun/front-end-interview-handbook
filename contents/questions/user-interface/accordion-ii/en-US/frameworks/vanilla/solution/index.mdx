## Solution

We'll build on top of [Accordion's solution](/questions/user-interface/accordion/vanilla/solution). Other than adding the right ARIA roles and states, which is straightforward, we also need to link the accordion headers with the corresponding accordion contents/panels. Hence we create two functions, `getAccordionHeaderId` and `getAccordionPanelId` to do this.

- `getAccordionHeaderId` generates a unique ID string to use as the value of the `id` attribute of the header element. This ID will be used as the value of the `aria-labelledby` attribute of the corresponding accordion panel.
- `getAccordionPanelId` generates a unique ID string to use as the value of the `id` attribute of accordion panel. This ID will be used as the value of the `aria-controls` attribute of the corresponding accordion header.

Since there can be multiple accordion component instances on the page and we cannot guarantee that the accordion item values will be globally unique, each accordion instance needs to have a unique identifier. We can create a `newID` function that generates a unique ID which under the hood is a globally-incrementing integer. The final ID string will be a concatenation of the accordion instance's ID, the item value, and whether it's an accordion header or panel.
