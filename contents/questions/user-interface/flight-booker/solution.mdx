## Solution

This question evaluates your knowledge of form validation and dependent form fields.

### Rendering

We can use `<input type="date">` to render native datepickers, which has over [96% browser support globally](https://caniuse.com/?search=input%20date) at the time of writing. Native datepickers also come with the `min` attributes, which we can use for ensuring that only valid dates are chosen.

The input fields and buttons are also wrapped in a `<form>` so that we can leverage native form submission and validation. Submission can be trigged by clicking the "Book" button or hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> on any of the form fields. The browser will first validate the inputs and trigger the submit event if the fields are valid.

### State

Since we need to toggle the display of the return field, we will need a state value to track whether the selected flight is "One-way" or "Return" to know whether to render the return date input.

The `formatDate` function converts a JavaScript `Date` object into a `YYYY-MM-DD` string which is the format expected by `<input type="date">`.
