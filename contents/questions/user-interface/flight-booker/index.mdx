Build a component that books a one-way or return flight for specified dates.

## Requirements

- The user can choose from two flight options: "One-way flight" and "Return flight".
- Input date fields
  - The date input fields represent the departure date and return dates.
  - The return date input is displayed if the "Return flight" option is chosen, hidden otherwise.
- Form validation should be done upon submission for invalid fields:
  - Dates are in the past.
  - Return date is before the departure date.
- Upon successful submission, a message is displayed informing the user of the selection:
  - One-way flight: "You have booked a one-way flight on YYYY-MM-DD"
  - Return-flight "You have booked a return flight, departing on YYYY-MM-DD and returning on YYYY-MM-DD"

Here's an example of the component, with both "One-way flight" and "Return flight" options.

## Resources

- The [`<input type="date">` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date) would be helpful for the date input fields.
