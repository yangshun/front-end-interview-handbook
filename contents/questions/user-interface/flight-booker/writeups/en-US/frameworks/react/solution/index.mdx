<Solution />

Using a form that constantly tracks the input values (controlled form) is more convenient than native forms approach (uncontrolled forms), as having state for the date values allows us to specify the current departure date as the `min` of the return date `<input>` field and leverage the browser's form validation during submission. Otherwise, we'll have to write custom validation logic in the submission handler.

Controlled forms are achieved in React by calling the state setter in the `<input>`'s `onChange` callback. This makes it straightforward to capture the current value of these elements directly in our component's state, and any state changes are instantly updated in the UI.
