## Solution

We can separate out the solution into two parts, the update loop and the rendering.

### Update loop

We need a timer to refresh the page and display the current time every second. To create the timer, we can use a `setInterval`

Do remember to register a callback to `onUnmounted` lifecycle hook to clear the timer to avoid memory leaks.

Store the JavaScript `Date` object as state as it contains all the data we need.

For better reusability, these logic can be abstracted into a custom `useCurrentDate` composable. We can use `onScopeDispose` as a replacement for `unmounted` lifecycle hook since this method can be used as a replacement for `onUnmounted` in reusable composition functions.

For better reusability, these logic can be abstracted into a custom `useCurrentDate` hook.

This part is exactly the same as the [Digital Clock](/questions/user-interface/digital-clock) question.

### Rendering

To make the clock more reusable and customizable, we can make the clock size as a property. The clock hands can then be a proportion of the clock's size.

To render the clock hands in the right position, we use a combination of `position: absolute` and CSS transforms:

1. `position: absolute` with `top` and `left` of half the clock size to make the hands start from the center of the clock. However, the hands will be pointing downwards.
1. Use `transform: rotate(180deg)` on the clock to make the hands point upwards. This step is optional if we add an 180 degree offset to the rotation angle of the hands.
1. Use `transform-origin: center top` to make the hands rotate around the center of the clock.
1. Use `transform: rotate(Xdeg)` on the hands to rotate them into the final angle.
