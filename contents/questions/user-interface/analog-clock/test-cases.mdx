## Test cases

- See that the second hand updates every second.
- Observe the clock for a minute to see that the minute hand updates correctly (gradually moved since the observation started).
- Check that the hour hand's position is different when it's not an exact hour, aka the hour hand's position at 12.00pm and 12.30pm should be different.
