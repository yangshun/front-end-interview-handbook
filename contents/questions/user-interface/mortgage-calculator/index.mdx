Build a simple mortgage calculator widget that takes in a loan amount, interest rate, loan term, and calculates the monthly mortgage payment, total payment amount, and total interest paid.

## Requirements

- The user should be able to enter:
  - Loan amount ($)
  - Annual interest rate (%). This is also known as the annual percentage rate (APR)
  - Loan term (in years)
- Using the inputs, the calculator should compute the following and display the results to the user:
  - Monthly mortgage payment
  - Total payment amount
  - Total interest paid
- If a non-numerical string is entered into any input field, the calculator should display an error message. Additionally, the calculator should handle any other invalid inputs that may arise.
- Round the result amounts to 2 decimal places.

_The last two requirements might not be given to you during interviews, you're expected to clarify._

The formula for calculating the monthly payment is:

_*M = P(i(1+i)<sup>n</sup>)/((1+i)<sup>n</sup> - 1)*_

- M: Monthly mortgage payment
- P: Loan amount
- i: Monthly interest rate (APR / 12)
- n: Total number of payments (loan term in years x 12)
