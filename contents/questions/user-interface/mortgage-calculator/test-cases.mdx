## Test cases

- Basic case
  - Enter a loan amount, interest rate, and loan term for a simple mortgage scenario, and verify that the monthly mortgage payment and total amount paid are calculated correctly. For example, a 30-year mortgage on a $100,000 loan at 3% interest rate should result in a monthly payment of **$421.60**, a total amount paid of **$151,777.45**, and total interest of **$51,777.45**.
- Invalid inputs
  - Leave the loan amount field blank and submit. Expect to see an error message prompting the user to fill out the field.
  - Try to enter text instead of numeric characters in any of the fields. `<input type="number">` should prevent non-numeric characters from being entered.
