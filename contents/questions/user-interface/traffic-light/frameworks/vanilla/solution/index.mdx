## Solution

### Data Model

Traffic lights are simple state machines where each color is a state and each state is shown for a fixed duration before moving to the next. We can capture the state information (how long to remain in each color for and which color to transition to) using a simple JavaScript object:

```js
const config = {
  red: {
    duration: 4000,
    next: 'green',
  },
  yellow: {
    duration: 500,
    next: 'red',
  },
  green: {
    duration: 3000,
    next: 'yellow',
  },
};
```

Within the `trafficLight` component, we only need a single state variable, which is the current color. We also set a timer via `setTimeout` to transition to the next color by looking up the `config` object to know what the next color is and when to do so.

The `beforeunload` event is fired before the tab/window is closed so we clear any running timers when the tab/window is about to be closed.

### Rendering

The rendering of this component is pretty straightforward and can be achieved with Flexbox. With Flexbox, it's also easy to change the layout of the lights from a vertical one to a horizontal one just by changing the `flex-direction` property.

### Component API

It's a good practice to make components reusable by allowing customization of:

- What the states are.
- Next states.
- Each state's duration.
- The initial state.
- Traffic light layout (certain countries use certain layouts).

We also define the color of each light within the `config` object so that the component is both state and color agnostic. It's even possible to create 2-colored and 4-colored traffic lights just by modifying the `config` object without having to modify the component implementation.
