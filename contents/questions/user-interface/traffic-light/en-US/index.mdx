Build a traffic light where the lights switch from green to yellow to red after predetermined intervals and loop indefinitely. Each light should be lit for the following durations:

- Red light: 4000ms
- Yellow light: 500ms
- Green light: 3000ms

You are free to exercise your creativity to style the appearance of the traffic light.
