Build a widget that fetches birth year data from an [API](https://www.random.org/integers/?num=200&min=1950&max=2019&col=1&base=10&format=plain) and display the data in a histogram, bucketing by the data by decades.

## Requirements

- We'll use [random.org's random number generator](https://www.random.org/integers/?num=200&min=1950&max=2019&col=1&base=10&format=plain) to simulate an API that returns 200 random data points from 1950 to 2019.
- Tabulate the data by bucketing the data by decades and plotting a histogram with the x-axis being the decade buckets and y-axis being the count.
- The y-axis should be appropriately labeled.

The example below shows a potential resulting histogram but you are free to style it.

## Notes

- In practice, you are usually not required to tabulate the API response data. However during interviews this is a possible task as the act of writing code to tabulate data provides good signal on coding fundamentals.
