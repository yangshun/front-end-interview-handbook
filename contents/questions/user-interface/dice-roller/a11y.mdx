## Accessibility

- Add `<label>`s for the `<input>`s and link them together using `<label for="...">` and `<input id="...">`.
- Use `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` on the HTML element displaying the dice. A hidden element is also rendered within so that screen readers will announce the result when a new dice roll is performed.
