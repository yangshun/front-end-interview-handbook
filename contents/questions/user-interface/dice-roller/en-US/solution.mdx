## Solution

The solution can be broken down into a few parts:

1. Collecting form data.
1. Generating dice values.
1. Displaying the dice values.

### State

The only state value we need for this dice roller is the values of the rolled dice, which can be represented as an array of values that range from 1 to 6.

### Collecting form data

Since the transfer of data from the form is one-directional, a basic HTML form will suffice.

By using `<input type="number" required="true" min="1" max="12" />`, we ensure only integer values can be entered and leverage HTML validation so that the minimum value of the fields is 1 and maximum is 12. Empty fields are also prevented via the `required` attribute.

### Generating dice values

With the number of dice obtained from the form, we can write a function to generate the required values.

To generate a value from 1 to 6, we can use `Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1,`. This randomization will be repeated for each dice.

### Displaying the dice values

Observe that there are 7 different positions the dots can take on a 6-sided dice. By using `position: absolute` and the appropriate `top`/`left`/`right`/`bottom` set to 0, the corner dots can be displayed correctly. The dots on the center row will require an additional negative translation transform to make them perfectly center.

Each dot is independent of the others and multiple dots can be combined to display the desired visual result for a dice value.

Lastly, we create an object that maps the dice value to the dot configuration classes. Value of 1 will require the center dot only, a value of 2 will require the top right and bottom left dots, etc.
