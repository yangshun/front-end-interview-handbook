## Solution

We'll build on top of [Modal Dialog's solution](/questions/user-interface/modal-dialog/solution). Other than adding the right ARIA roles and states, which is straightforward, we also need to link the title and content elements.

Linking the title and content to the modal dialog element is done via the `aria-labelledby` attribute and `aria-describedby` attribute respectively, by using the `id` values of the title and content as the `aria-` values.

Since there can be multiple modal dialog component instances on the page and `id`s are meant to be unique within the page, we cannot hardcode values for these attributes.

We can expose props for these `id` values and let it be the user's job to ensure that the values are unique. However, these `id` values are rarely used beyond fulfilling a11y requirements and it is not meaningful work for users. We should generate the IDs for users if possible.

We can generate two IDs â€“ one for the title and another for the content, and use them as such in the markup:

```jsx
<div aria-labelledby={titleId} aria-describedby={contentId}>
  <h1 id={titleId}>...</h1>
  <div id={contentId}>...</div>
</div>
```

In frameworks like React, the `useId` hook can be used to generate IDs that will be unique per modal dialog instance.

### Splitting the component

Since hooks cannot be called conditionally and there's no need to call the `useId` hook when the modal dialog is not open, the component can be split into two with the bulk of the component within `ModalDialogImpl` so that the `useId` hooks are not called unnecessarily.
