## Test cases

Let the game be configured with `PLAYERS` players and the winning condition be `COUNT_TO_WIN` consecutive discs of the same color.

For a given `ROWS`-by-`COLUMNS` grid `grid` and a given `player`,

- For any given column `i`:
  - If there is at least one empty cell `cell`, dropping a disc will result in `cell` being filled with `player`'s disc color.
  - Dropping a disc in a column will fill spaces from the bottom.
  - If there is no empty cell, a disc cannot be placed in the column. If you have other behaviors for this case, expect it to happen too.
- When a disc is dropped into some cell `cell`, for each of the four directions: ─, │, ╲, and ╱ that crosses `cell`,
  - If there are at least `COUNT_TO_WIN` consecutive cells filled with `player`'s disc color, there's an indicator for the winning player.
  - Otherwise, the color of the disc to drop in the next turn is the next player in `PLAYERS`'s.
- Game progress:
  - Players can take turns to drop the discs until a player wins or a there's a draw.
  - If all cells are filled and no player has won, a draw indicator appears.
- Game conclusion
  - When the winning or a draw indicator appears, no more discs can be dropped.
- Clicking on the "Reset" button will turn all cells `grid` to its base color, and clear any winning or draw indicators.
