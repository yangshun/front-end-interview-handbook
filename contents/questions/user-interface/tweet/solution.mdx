## Solution

This question evaluates a developer's skills on turning a designer's mock into code using HTML and CSS. The CSS involved is not too complex, basic usage of flexbox should be sufficient.

- Flex is your friend for most modern layout needs. Be familiar with how it works.
- `column-gap` and `row-gap` are very useful here since it won't render the spacing if there are no elements (it's possible that there are no counts for the tweet actions).
- Equal spacing between tweet actions can be achieved using `display: flex; flex: space-between` on the container.
- We can use CSS custom properties/variables to keep the `height`/`width` values of the thumbnail and icons in-sync since they are meant to be square. Preprocessors can also do the job, but CSS variables is preferred now since it's a browser native feature.
