## Accessibility

- Link `<label>`s to `<input>` so that clicking on the `<label>` will focus on the corresponding `<input>`.
  - Use `<label for="some-id">` and `<input id="some-id">` to define the relation between `<label>` and `<input>`.
  - You can nest `<input>`s inside of `<label>`s but note that some assistive technologies (e.g. Dragon NaturallySpeaking) do not support it.
- Apply a styling for `<input>` focus to clearly tell users which field they're on.
- Link the error message up with the password confirmation field by using `aria-describedby` to indicate that the error message is for that `<input>` field.
