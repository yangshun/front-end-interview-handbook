## Solution

### Props

The default memory game shown in the diagram is 4 x 4 and the goal is to match pairs. In order to make the game customizable, we can introduce the following props:

- `rows`: Number of rows.
- `cols`: Number of columns.
- `matchCount`: How many of the same images there are. The default is 2 but making it a parameter is a positive signal.
- `delay`: Delay before selected non-matching cards are flipped back over.

Since these parameters can be combined in ways that make the game unplayable, we can do a basic check of whether the total number of cells is divisible by the match count.

### State

- `cards`: The game board can be represented as a one-dimensional array called `cards`, containing the correct number of groups of unique emojis. On a 4 x 4 board, the array has a length of 16 and `cards[4]` will correspond to row 2 column 1. This array is generated during initialization and not modified throughout the duration of the game. It's only regenerated when the user chooses to play again.
- `flipped`: An array of indices to track which cards are flipped. This array excludes matched cards.
- `matched`: A set of images (emojis) that have been matched.
- `waitTimer`: A variable to track the timer ID for whether to automatically flip back the cards after `delay` duration.
- `gameCompleted`: Boolean value to represent whether the game is completed.

### Rendering

CSS grid is used to render the cards in a 2-dimensional format. It's a great choice because you can render the cards as a single list of DOM elements but with the right CSS grid settings, they can be displayed in a rows x cols layout.

### Card Generation

The following process can be used for generating the cards:

1. Make N groups of `matchCount` emojis where N = total cells / `matchCount` in a single array.
1. Shuffle the array.

### `onFlip`

For the most part, `onFlip` adds cards to the `selected` array. If there aren't enough cards to make a decision whether there's a match yet, the function terminates. When enough cards are selected, check whether all the selected cards are similar. If so, we can add the selected emoji to the `matched` set and reset `selected` to be empty so that the player can continue with the game. If there isn't a match, we wait for `delay` duration to pass before flipping the selected cards back over.

If a player tries flipping more cards before the `delay` elapses, the already flipped cards (that aren't matched) need to be reset immediately. Using `clearTimeout` with the timer stored in `waitTimer` achieves this.
