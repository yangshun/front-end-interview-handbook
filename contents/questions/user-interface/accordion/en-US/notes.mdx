## Accessibility

Interactive elements need to be focusable, so we'll use a `<button>` for the title.

The [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide for Accordion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion) has a long list of guidelines for the ARIA roles, states, and properties to add to the various elements of an accordion. [Accordion II](/questions/user-interface/accordion-ii) and [Accordion III](/questions/user-interface/accordion-iii) will focus on improving the accessibility of the Accordion component.
