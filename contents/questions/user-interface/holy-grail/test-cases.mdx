## Test cases

- Test variable width: the navigation and sidebar columns should be fixed width and the middle column is fluid and fills up any remaining space.
- Test variable height: the header and footer rows should be fixed width and the footer should always be at the bottom of the window.
- Test lots of content within `main`. It should not cause the `nav` and `aside` to shrink.
