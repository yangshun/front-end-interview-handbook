## Solution

We first construct the DOM to render the number of stars and a `highlightStars` function which highlights all the stars smaller than the passed in `index` (0-based).

We also need to variable `currentValue` to track the latest value which determines the highlighted state unhovered. This is needed because we need to revert to that state when the cursor is not hovering over any stars.

Then we add a few event listeners to the root component of the widget:

- `click`: Using event delegation, we only have to add one click event handler per widget. We can determine the index of the currently clicked star using `event.target.closest` and add/remove the `star-icon-filled` class from the stars depending on the index of the clicked star.
- `mouseover`: Using event delegation, we only have to add one mouseover event handler per widget. We can determine the index of the currently hovered star using `event.target.closest` and add/remove the `star-icon-filled` class from the stars depending on the index of the clicked star. This takes priority over the currently filled stars.
- `mouseout`: Reset the filled state to before the `mouseover` event. Event delegation is not needed here because there's no specific star involved.
