Build a simple temperature converter widget that contains two text inputs temperatures in Celsius and Fahrenheit respectively, allowing for conversion between the temperature scales.

## Requirements

- Initially, both fields are empty. When a number value is entered into a text input, the other input will be calculated and reflected.
- Round to 4 decimal places where necessary.
- If a non-numerical string is entered into one input, the other input will be blank.

_The last two requirements might not be given to you during interviews, you're expected to clarify._

P.S. To convert temperatures in degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply by 1.8 (or 9/5) and add 32.
