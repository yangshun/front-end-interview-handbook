## Notes

- Use a `<label>` for the form fields to indicate what the input is for.
- Using `<input type="number">` is helpful for allowing only numerical values and stepper controls.
- Number formatting is tricky:
  - `Number()` constructor: converts a value into a number or `NaN` if not possible. note that this returns `Number(anyFalseyValue)` gives 0, so we need to differentiate the empty string case from a real 0.
  - `Number.IsNaN()`: determine if a value is a number.
  - `/\.\d{5}/`: this regex tests is a number has 5 or more decimal places.
