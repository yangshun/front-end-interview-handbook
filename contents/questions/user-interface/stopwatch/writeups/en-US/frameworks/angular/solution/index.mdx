## Solution

This question looks simple on first glance but is actually more complex than it seems. Note that setInterval's delay parameter is unreliable. The actual amount of time that elapses between calls to the callback may be longer than the given delay due to various reasons. Because of this behavior, we cannot assume that each time the interval callback is fired, the same duration as passed. We will need to read the current time within the callback code to ensure that we are using the most updated timings.

To run the timer we need to invoke `toggleTimer()` method that checks if we have active timer. If we don't - we're going to start it.

In `startTimer()` method we calculate `lastTickTiming` as it was described above and start `setInterval()`. Each time variable is recalculated separately every 1ms (should be). Regarding to last variable `milliseconds` - we will use the pipe `padTwoDigit` to display it cleaner on the template so for example instead of displaying 65 we will display that as 06.5 and so on.

Calling `resetTimer()` we run `stopInterval` that uses window function `clearInterval` to prevent memory leaks and we set all variables to initial state which is 0.

### State

In `AppComponent` we're going to store following variables:

- `timerId` - Returned value from `setInterval` function to stop the interval to prevent memory leaks. As default we set this to 0.
- `totalDuration`: Total time that has passed so far.
- `lastTickTiming`: This is the time that the last interval callback has run. We will keep incrementing the `totalDuration` by the delta between the current time (`Date.now()`) and the `lastTickTiming`. Using this approach, the `totalDuration` will still be accurate even if the callbacks run at irregular intervals.
- `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`, `milliseconds` - time variables to be displayed on the template.

### Angular Insights

- You can adopt a more advanced, reactive-like approach using RxJS (without using subscriptions as possible). However, if you opt for subscriptions, remember about destroying them to prevent memory leaks.

- You might create service for maintaining the state. Inject the service in smart component and crete dumb components that only display and interact with the UI and all events from dumb components are passed to the smart one.

- If you're confident with the latest Angular versions, consider using signals standalone API.

- You can try to focus more on keywords such as `readonly`, `private`, `public` and `void`.

- If you're creating a bigger application it would be good practice to use styles per component instead of putting all styles in one file.
