Build a UI that shows a list of users within a database (client-side) and contains the following elements and behaviors:

## Requirements

- The listbox shows a list of all users in the database. At most one entry can be selected at a time.
- By entering a string into the "Search" input, users containing the string will be filtered. The filtering happens immediately without submission / pressing Enter.
- "Create" button:
  - Only enabled when no users are selected and when both name fields are filled.
  - Upon activation, a new user is created based on the name input fields and added to the database. The input fields are then cleared.
- "Update" button:
  - Only enabled when there is a user selected.
  - Upon activation, the selected user's name is updated in the database.
- "Delete" button:
  - Only enabled when there is a user selected.
  - Upon activation, the selected user is removed from the database.
- "Cancel" button:
  - Only enabled when there is a user selected.
  - Upon activation, any selected user and both name input fields are cleared.
