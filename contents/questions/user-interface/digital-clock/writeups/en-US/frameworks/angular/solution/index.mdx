## Solution

In `ngOnInit()` hook, we will run a timer to refresh the page and display the current time every second. To create the timer, we can use `setInterval` to initiate the update of our state properties. Within the `setInterval` body, we will update `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds` and `dateTimeDisplay` (required for `<timer>`) based on the current date. In `ngOnDestroy()`, we will terminate the interval to prevent memory leaks.

Every `DigitComponent` displays one digit in the clock, so assuming we have time 22:04:22, we put `hours` to the first two digits and `floor` it with `pipe` hours / 10 and hours % 10.

The numbers passed will be 2.1 floored to 2 and 1 which is exact hour we need to display and so on.

`DigitComponent` is a typical dumb component, used solely for displaying UI based on a number passed by `@Input`. The responsibility of this component is to display one digit and most of the work here involves manipulating styles.

`SeparatorComponent` is a dumb UI component designed to display two separator dots between digits.

### Angular Insights

- You can adopt a more advanced, reactive-like approach using RxJS (without using subscriptions as possible). However, if you opt for subscriptions, remember about destroying them to prevent memory leaks.

- You might create service for maintaining the state. Inject the service in smart component and crete dumb components that only display and interact with the UI and all events from dumb components are passed to the smart one.

- If you're confident with the latest Angular versions, consider using signals standalone API.

- You can try to focus more on keywords such as `readonly`, `private`, `public` and `void`.

- If you're creating a bigger application it would be good practice to use styles per component instead of putting all styles in one file.
