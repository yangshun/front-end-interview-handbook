## Accessibility

Use of semantic HTML elements like `<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`, etc. will automatically provide with some accessibility.

- <kbd>Tab</kbd> will move the focus to the next field
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> will move the focus to the
  previous field

Note: Other key presses are handled via `onKeyDown` function.
