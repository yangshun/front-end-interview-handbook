![Transfer List Example](/img/questions/transfer-list-ii/transfer-list-example.png)

## Requirements

- There are two lists each initially containing 4 items.
- Selection
  - Each item has a checkbox that can be checked/unchecked.
  - Clicking on the checkbox at the top of each column will:
    - Select all items if none or only some items are selected.
    - Unselect all items if all items are selected.
  - The checkbox at the top of each column shows:
    - Unchecked if no items are selected.
    - Indeterminate if some items are selected.
    - Checked if all items are selected.
- Transferring
  - Clicking on the single arrow buttons will transfer the selected items, as specified by the direction of the arrows.
  - Transferred items are added to the bottom of the destination list.
  - Item selection (checked) states are preserved after transferring.
  - Buttons are disabled if there are no relevant items to be transferred.
- Adding new items
  - Items can be added to the bottom of each list by entering text in the input at the top of each list.
  - Assume that all items are unique and that items present in any list will not be added again.
