title: Progress Bars III
excerpt: Build a list of progress bars that fill up gradually concurrently, up to a limit of 3

**Note:** This is an advanced version of [Progress Bars II](/questions/user-interface/progress-bars-ii), you should complete that question first before attempting this question.

In [Progress Bars II](/questions/user-interface/progress-bars-ii), we built progress bars which fill up in sequence, one at a time. In this question, we'll build progress bars where multiple of them are filling up concurrently, up to a limit of 3. The fourth progress bar only starts filling up after the first one is full.

## Requirements

- Clicking on the "Add" button adds a progress bar to the page.
- The progress bars fill up gradually in parallel, up to a limit of 3 concurrent bars filling up. i.e. the fourth progress bar will only start filling up after the first progress bar is completely filled up.
- Each bar takes approximately 2000ms to completely fill up.

**Hint:** Realize that changing the concurrency limit to 1 reduces this question into the simpler [Progress Bars II](/questions/user-interface/progress-bars-ii) question. The solution to this question only requires a one-line change to the solution of [Progress Bars II](/questions/user-interface/progress-bars-ii/solution).
