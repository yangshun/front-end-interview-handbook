**Note:** This is an advanced version of [Progress Bars II](/questions/user-interface/progress-bars-ii), you should complete that question first before attempting this question.

## Solution

The only change we have to make to the solution from [Progress Bars II](/questions/user-interface/progress-bars-ii) is the way we are determining whether `isEmpty={true}` (whether a bar is allowed to increment).

```jsx
<ProgressBar isEmpty={index > numFilledUpBars} />

// The above can be rewritten as:
<ProgressBar isEmpty={index >= numFilledUpBars + 1} />

// Extract the concurrency limit as a variable:
const CONCURRENCY_LIMIT = 1;
<ProgressBar isEmpty={index >= numFilledUpBars + CONCURRENCY_LIMIT} />
// And we can change the value of CONCURRENCY_LIMIT to 3 to solve the question.
```

With this change, up to 3 non-full bars will have `<ProgressBar isEmpty={false} />` which provides the concurrency needed to solve this question.
