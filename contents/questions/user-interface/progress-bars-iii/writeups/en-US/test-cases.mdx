## Test cases

- Hitting "Add" appends a new empty progress bar to the bottom of the list.
  - The first bar starts filling up as soon as it appears.
- Hit "Add" 4 times in quick succession to have 4 bars in total. The first 3 bars should start filling up and the fourth only starts filling up after the first one completes.
- If an existing bar is filled up, any empty bar starts filling up immediately.
