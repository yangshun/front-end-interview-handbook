## Solution

In `AppComponent` we will create our game with given params and whole logic will take place in container `WordleComponent.` The rest of the components `LetterGridComponent`, `KeyboardComponent`, and `GameResultComponent` will be dumb components only for displaying UI and not dealing with the logic.

### `LetterGridComponent`

Displays grid and set proper styling depending on `LetterGuessState` enum.

### `KeyboardComponent`

As the name suggests this component is responsible for interacting with keyboard. Depending on `LetterGuessState` it also styles the keys on the UI and each letter pressed is sent to container `WordleComponent`.

### `GameResultComponent`

Displays game result depending on game result and allows to reset the game.

### `WordleComponent`

Container component that will manage whole game logic and hold the state. Based on given inputs `lettersPerWord` and `maxAttempts` he will configure game those game rules in hook `ngOnInit`.

#### `addLetter`

This function is called when a letter key is pressed. It adds the pressed letter to the grid at the current cursor position if there is space available in the row.

#### `deleteLetter`

This function is called when the backspace key is pressed. It deletes the letter at the current cursor position in the grid. If there are no letters in the current row, calling this function does nothing.

#### `checkWord`

This function is the most complex function among all the functions. It is called when the enter key is pressed to check if the word in the current row is correct. There are a few main parts to this function:

1. Firstly, check each letter for exact matches. The states of the grid and letter guesses are updated to be `'CORRECT'`. If all the letters match, we can terminate the function and end the game.
1. Next, we update the states of the remaining characters. The remaining characters can be one of the following:
   - Present: If a character is present in `letterFreq` and `letterFreq.get(char)` is 0, it means that it has already been marked as `'CORRECT'` in the previous step. A positive value means that the character is present but not in the correct position. We need to use a frequency instead of simply checking the existence of the character because a word can use the same character multiple times. These characters will be marked as `'PRESENT'`.
   - Absent: The character is not present in `letterFreq` at all, or has a value of 0 (the same letter was used in another position correctly), we can mark it as `'ABSENT'`.
1. Lastly, if all the guesses were used up without finding the correct word, the game ends and the correct word is shown. Otherwise, the cursor moves to the next row.

#### `resetGame`

This function resets the game state to its initial values when called. It sets a new word of the day, resets the letter grid, the cursor position, the game state, and the letter guess state.

### State

The code uses several state variables to manage the game state and user interactions. Here's an explanation of each state variable and its purpose:

- `wordOfTheDay`: This state variable stores the randomly selected word that the player needs to guess. It is initialized with a random word from the predefined list `WORDS`. It is used to compare the player's guesses and determine if they have guessed the word correctly.
- `gameState`: This state variable represents the overall state of the game. It can have three possible values:
  - `GAME_STATE.IN_PROGRESS`: The game is still in progress, and the player can continue making guesses.
  - `GAME_STATE.GUESSED_CORRECTLY`: The player has guessed the word correctly within the allowed attempts.
  - `GAME_STATE.NO_MORE_GUESSES`: The player has used all the attempts without guessing the word correctly.
- `gridState`: This state variable is a 2D array that represents the state of the grid, where each cell represents a letter in the word. It stores an object with two properties: `char` (the letter) and `state` (the state of the letter guess). The `gridState` is initialized using the `getInitialGridState` function.
- `position`: This state variable represents the current position of the cursor in the grid. It is a 2-element array with the row and column index. The initial position is set to `INITIAL_CURSOR_POSITION`, which is `[0, -1]` (before the first cell).
- `letterGuessState`: This state variable is an object that tracks the state of each letter guess made by the player. The keys of the object are the guessed letters, and the values are the corresponding guess states (`LETTER_GUESS_STATE`). The `getInitialLetterGuessState` function initializes it. This value is used by the virtual keyboard to determine which color to render the keys.

### Rendering

The solution heavily uses CSS variables to render the letters in the guesses and the virtual keyboard using the relevant state colors. CSS variables are used since the color values are used in multiple parts of the UI.

### Models

We store all our models in `models.ts` file and come up with the following ideas for letter guess state, game state and grid state which is combined with `LetterGuessState`.

```typescript
export interface GridState {
  char: string;
  state: LetterGuessState;
}
```

```typescript
export enum LetterGuessState {
  INDETERMINATE = 'INDETERMINATE',
  ABSENT = 'ABSENT',
  PRESENT = 'PRESENT',
  CORRECT = 'CORRECT',
}
```

```typescript
export enum GameState {
  IN_PROGRESS = 'IN_PROGRESS',
  GUESSED_CORRECTLY = 'GUESSED_CORRECTLY',
  NO_MORE_GUESSES = 'NO_MORE_GUESSES',
}
```

### Angular Insights

- You can adopt a more advanced, reactive-like approach using RxJS (without using subscriptions as possible). However, if you opt for subscriptions, remember about destroying them to prevent memory leaks.

- You might create service for maintaining the state. Inject the service in smart component and crete dumb components that only display and interact with the UI and all events from dumb components are passed to the smart one.

- If you're confident with the latest Angular versions, consider using signals standalone API.

- You can try to focus more on keywords such as `readonly`, `private`, `public` and `void`.

- If you're creating a bigger application it would be good practice to use styles per component instead of putting all styles in one file.
