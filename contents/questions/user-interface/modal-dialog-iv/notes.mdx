## Follow up

A possible problematic scenario is having multiple dialogs open at once / stacked because the open dialog's contents allow opening of another dialog.

A limitation of our current implementation is surfaced â€“ since most of the event listeners are added on the global level, all the open dialogs might respond to a <kbd>Escape</kbd> event and close at the same time, when the expected behavior is that only the topmost dialog closes.

Fixing this will require code to track the stack of open dialogs and only close the topmost dialog. However, implementing this is non-trivial and usually beyond the scope of interviews. That said, mentioning this scenario to the interviewer will probably give you brownie points!
