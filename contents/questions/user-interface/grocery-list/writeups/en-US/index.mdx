Build a grocery list app where you can search for groceries, add them to a list, mark items as checked, and remove added items.

![Grocery List Example](/img/questions/grocery-list/grocery-list-example.png)

## Requirements

- Adding items
  - Users can add items by typing in an input field.
  - The input field shows autocomplete suggestions based on the user's input.
  - Items can be added by hitting enter (which will add whatever is in the input) or selecting an item in the suggestions list.
  - Added items will appear in a list below in the unchecked state.
  - The same item can be added multiple times.
  - Upon adding, the input field is cleared.
- Marking items as checked
  - Pressing the ⚪ beside the item name will mark it as checked.
  - Checked items are grayed out, the ⚪ is replaced with ✅ and item names have a line through them.
  - Pressing the ✅ will turn the items back to unchecked.
- Deleting items
  - Items can be deleted by pressing the ❌ on the right.

## Notes for Solution Author (delete after completion):

- Make sure to debounce the searching.
- Wrap `<input>` in `<form>` for submit-to-Enter behavior.
- Don't need to add keyboard navigation for autocomplete (reserved ).
- "Check" and "Delete" should be built using `<button>`s and have appropriate `aria-label`s such as "Mark [item] as complete/incomplete" and "Delete [item]" respectively.
