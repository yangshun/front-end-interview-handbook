title: Task Coordination
excerpt: Implement a function to find minimum intervals for tasks with cooldown
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given a list of tasks, each represented by a letter (from A to Z), and a cooldown period `k`. The cooldown period specifies that the same task must be separated by at least `k` intervals between executions.

Determine the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks, while ensuring that the same task is not executed again before the cooldown period has passed.

### Input

- `tasks: string[]`: An array of characters, where each task is represented as a letter (A-Z)
- `k: number`: An integer representing the cooldown period, the minimum number of intervals between two executions of the same task

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `tasks.length` &lt;= 1000
- `tasks[i]` is an uppercase English letter
- 0 &lt;= `k` &lt;= 100
