title: Heap
excerpt: Implement a heap data structure containing essential heap operations
---

Implement a heap data structure in JavaScript that supports the following operations:

- `new Heap(array)`: Creates an instance of a Heap class initialized with `array` and heapifies it to form as the initial Heap structure. It also initializes any internal structure needed to maintain the heap properties.
- `heapify(array)`: Constructs the heap from an unordered array, establishing the max heap property across all elements. This is performed as part of the constructor, or can be a separate method that resets and rebuilds the heap. Required time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- `insert(value)`: Adds a new value to the heap, maintaining the max heap property. Required time complexity: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the heap after insertion.
- `delete()`: Removes and returns the maximum value from the heap, maintaining the max heap property after removal. Required time complexity: O(log n).
- `findMax()`: Returns the maximum value in the heap without removing it. Required time complexity: O(1).

## Examples

```js
const heap = new Heap();
heap.insert(20);
heap.insert(15);
heap.insert(30);
heap.findMax(); // 30
heap.insert(10);
heap.delete(); // 30
heap.findMax(); // 20

const array = [5, 3, 17, 10, 84, 19, 6, 22, 9];
const newHeap = new Heap(array);
newHeap.findMax(); // 84
```
