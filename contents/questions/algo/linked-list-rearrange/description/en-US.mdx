title: Rearrange Linked List
excerpt: Implement a function to rearrange the nodes in a linked list
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given the head of a [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), `head`, reorder the list to alternate between nodes from the start and the end of the list. The reordering should be performed by rearranging the nodes themselves, without modifying the values stored in the nodes.

The original structure is as follows:

`L0 → L1 → ... → Ln-1 → Ln`

Reorganize the list into this structure:

`L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …`

The linked list is represented by a sequence of `ListNode`s, where each node points to the next node in the sequence, or `null` if it is the last node.

A `ListNode` has the following interface:

```ts
interface ListNode {
  val: number;
  next: ListNode | null;
}
```

### Input

- `head: ListNode`: Head of the linked list. Examples display each linked list as an array of values within the list

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= Number of nodes &lt;= 1000
- 1 &lt;= `ListNode.val` &lt;= 1000
