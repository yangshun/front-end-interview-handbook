title: Number Stream Median
excerpt: Implement a function to find the median of a dynamic stream of integers
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

The median of a list of numbers is defined as the middle value in a sorted list. When the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values.

For example:

- For the list `[1, 2, 3]`, the median is 2
- For the list `[1, 2]`, the median is (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5

Implement a `NumberStream` class with the following methods:

- `add(num: number): void`: Adds an integer num to the data structure
- `getMedian(): number`: Returns the median of all numbers added so far

### Input

The `NumberStream` instance will have its methods called with various parameters based on these:

- `methods: string[]`: An array of `NumberStream` method names
- `params: (number | null)[]`: An array of integers

`methods[i]` will be called with `params[i]`.

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `num` &lt;= 100,000
- 1 &lt;= `methods.length` &lt;= 1000
- There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling `getMedian()`
