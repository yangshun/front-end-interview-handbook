title: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
excerpt: Implement a function to find the level order traversal of a binary tree
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given the `root` node of a binary tree, return an array of arrays, where each inner array represents the values of nodes at each level of the tree, traversed from left to right.

The binary tree is represented by a collection of `TreeNode`s, where each node has optional `left` and `right` child nodes, which are also `TreeNode`s.

A `TreeNode` has the following interface:

```ts
interface TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

### Input

- `root: TreeNode`: Root node of the tree. Examples display a [level-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) of the tree

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= Number of nodes &lt;= 10,000
- -100 &lt;= `TreeNode.val` &lt;= 100
