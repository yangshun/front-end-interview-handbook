title: Validate Binary Search Tree
excerpt: Implement a function to validate whether a binary tree is a valid binary search tree

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine whether it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

For a tree to qualify as a valid BST, it must satisfy the following conditions:

- The left subtree of a node only contains nodes with values less than the node's value
- The right subtree of a node only contains nodes with values greater than the node's value
- Both the left and right subtrees are also valid BSTs

The binary tree is represented by a collection of `TreeNode`s, where each node has optional `left` and `right` child nodes, which are also `TreeNode`s.

A `TreeNode` has the following interface:

```ts
interface TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

### Input

- `root: TreeNode`: Root node of the tree. Examples display a [level-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) of the tree

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= Number of nodes &lt;= 1000
- -1,000,000 &lt;= `TreeNode.val` &lt;= 1,000,000
