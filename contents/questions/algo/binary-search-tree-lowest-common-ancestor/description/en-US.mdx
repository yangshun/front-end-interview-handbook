title: Binary Search Tree Lowest Common Ancestor
excerpt: Implement a function to find the LCA in a binary search tree

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), identify the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two specified nodes within the tree.

The LCA is the lowest node in the tree that has both of the given nodes as descendants. A node can be considered a descendant of itself, following the standard definition of LCA.

The binary tree is represented by a collection of `TreeNode`s, where each node has optional `left` and `right` child nodes, which are also `TreeNode`s.

A `TreeNode` has the following interface:

```ts
interface TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

### Input

- `root: TreeNode`: Root node of the tree. Examples display a [level-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) of the tree
- `a: TreeNode`: The first tree node. Examples display the node's value
- `b: TreeNode`: The second tree node. Examples display the node's value

### Output

- A `TreeNode` object which is the LCA of `a` and `b`

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= Number of nodes &lt;= 1000
- 1 &lt;= `TreeNode.val` &lt;= 1,000,000
- `a` and `b` are guaranteed to exist in the BST
- All `TreeNode.val` are unique within the tree
