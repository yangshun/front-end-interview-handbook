## 1. Using Bit Manipulation

The given solution uses bit manipulation to calculate the sum of two numbers without using the addition operator. The key idea relies on understanding how binary addition works:

- The XOR operation (`^`) performs addition without carry. For example, in binary `1 ^ 1 = 0` and `0 ^ 1 = 1`.
- The AND operation (`&`) identifies where carry bits are generated. For example, in binary `1 & 1 = 1` and `0 & 1 = 0`.
- The left-shift operation (`<<`) moves the carry bits to the next higher position so they can be added in the subsequent iteration.

By iteratively applying these operations, the algorithm processes the carry bits until no carry remains, yielding the sum.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize the `carry` variable to hold carry bits generated during each iteration.
2. Continue looping as long as there are bits to process in `b` or there is a carry bit.
3. Extract the carry bits using the `a & b` operation and store the result in `carry`.
4. Use the XOR operation (`a ^ b`) to compute the sum without the carry bit and update `a`.
5. Left-shift the `carry` by one position (`carry << 1`) to align it with the next higher bit and assign the result to `b`.
6. Repeat steps 3â€“5 until both `b` and `carry` are zero.
7. Return `a`, which holds the final sum.

### Big-O analysis

- **Time complexity: O(1)**. Each integer contains 32 bits.
- **Space complexity: O(1)**. The algorithm uses constant space as it operates directly on the input variables.
