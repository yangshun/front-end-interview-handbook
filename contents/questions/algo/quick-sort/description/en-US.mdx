Implement a function that performs a recursive quick sort. The function should take in an array of integers. The output should be an array with the input sorted in ascending order.

## Examples

```js
quickSort([9, 3, 6, 2, 1, 11]); // [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 11]
quickSort([12, 16, 14, 1, 2, 3]); // [1, 2, 3, 12, 14, 16]
```

## Recap

Quick sort is an efficient, in-place, recursive sorting algorithm that selects a "pivot" element and partitions all other elements into 2 subarrays:

1. Elements that are smaller than the pivot are added in 1 subarray that is placed before the pivot.
1. Elements that are larger than the pivot are added in 1 subarray that is placed after the pivot.

The quick sort is then recursively applied to each subarray. and once the subarrays are sorted they are then merged back with the pivot element between them as per above.
