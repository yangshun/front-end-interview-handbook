title: Disjoint Intervals
excerpt: Implement a function to determine the minimum amount of removals to get non-overlapping intervals
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given an array of `intervals` where each interval is represented as `[start, end]`. Each pair denotes the start and end of an interval on a number line. For example, `[1, 3]` represents an interval that starts at 1 and ends at 3.

Find the minimum number of intervals that need to be removed so that the remaining intervals are disjoint.

Intervals are considered disjoint if no two intervals overlap on the number line. For example:

- `[1, 3]` and `[4, 6]` are disjoint because they do not share any common points
- `[1, 5]` and `[4, 6]` are not disjoint because they overlap at points between 4 and 5

### Input

- `intervals: Array<[number, number]>`: An array of integer pairs

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 0 &lt;= `intervals.length` &lt;= 100
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- 0 &lt;= `start` &lt;= `end` &lt;= 10,000
