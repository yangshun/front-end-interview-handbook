title: Find the Longest Palindromic Substring
excerpt: Implement a function to find the longest palindromic substring
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given a string `str`, return the longest contiguous substring that is a palindrome. If there are multiple such substrings, return any one of them.

A **palindrome** is a sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., `racecar`).

A **substring** is any contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For example, the substrings of string `abc` are `a`, `b`, `c`, `ab`, `bc`, and `abc`. A substring is formed by selecting a starting and ending point without skipping characters in between.

### Input

- `str: string`: A string

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `str.length` &lt;= 1000
- `str` contains only lowercase English letters
