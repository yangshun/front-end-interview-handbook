title: Longest Repeating Substring After Replacements
excerpt: Implement a function to find the longest uniform substring after up to k replacements

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given a string `str` consisting of uppercase English letters and an integer `k`, determine the length of the longest substring that can be formed where all characters are the same. A maximum of `k` character replacements can be made to achieve this.

A **substring** is any contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For example, the substrings of string `abc` are `a`, `b`, `c`, `ab`, `bc`, and `abc`. A substring is formed by selecting a starting and ending point without skipping characters in between.

### Input

- `str: string`: A string
- `k`: An integer

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `str.length` &lt;= 10,000
- `str` contains only uppercase English letters
