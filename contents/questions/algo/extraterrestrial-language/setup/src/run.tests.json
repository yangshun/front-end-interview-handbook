    "explanation": "Comparing 'cab' and 'abc', the first differing characters are c and a, suggesting c comes before a. Comparing 'abc' and 'bca', the first differing characters are a and b, so a comes before b. Thus, the order of letters in the new alphabet is 'cab'."

    "explanation": "The list is invalid because 'ab' should not come before 'abc'. A shorter word with the same prefix cannot appear after a longer word, so the sequence is impossible, and the result is an empty string."
