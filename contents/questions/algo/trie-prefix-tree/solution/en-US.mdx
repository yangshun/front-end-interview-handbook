## 1. Using Trie data structure

A Trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure used for efficient storage and retrieval of strings, particularly when working with prefixes. Each node in a Trie represents a single character and stores references to its child nodes. This structure enables fast operations such as inserting a word, searching for a word, and checking if any word starts with a given prefix.

The Trie is initialized with a root node that has links to its child nodes. Each link corresponds to a character from 'a' to 'z'. Words are inserted character by character into the Trie, creating new child nodes if a character does not exist. The search operation traverses the Trie to check if all characters of a word or prefix exist, while the `isEnd` flag at each node indicates whether the node marks the end of a word. The design efficiently handles operations involving prefixes, as shared prefixes are stored only once.

### Algorithm

1. **Insert**:

   - Start from the root node.
   - For each character in the word, check if the node contains a link for the character.
   - If not, create a new node and add it as a child.
   - Move to the child node and repeat for all characters.
   - Mark the last node as the end of a word using the `isEnd` flag.

2. **Search**:

   - Traverse the Trie using the characters of the word.
   - If any character is not found, the word does not exist.
   - Check if the last node represents the end of a word.

3. **StartsWith**:
   - Traverse the Trie using the characters of the prefix.
   - If all characters are found, the prefix exists in the Trie.

### Big-O analysis

- **Time complexity**:
  - Insert: O(m), where `m` is the length of the word being inserted.
  - Search: O(m), where `m` is the length of the word being searched.
  - StartsWith: O(m), where `m` is the length of the prefix.
- **Space complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the total number of characters across all inserted words. Each character requires a node in the Trie, and shared prefixes reduce redundancy.
