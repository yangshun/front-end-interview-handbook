A [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) (pronounced "try"), also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure designed to efficiently manage and query strings. It's particularly useful for tasks such as autocomplete and spell checking.

Implement a `Trie` class with the following methods:

- `insert(word: string): void`: Adds the given word to the `Trie`
- `search(word: string): boolean`: Checks if the specified word exists in the trie and returns `true` if it does, otherwise `false`
- `startsWith(prefix: string): boolean`: Checks if there is any word in the Trie that starts with the given prefix and returns `true` if such a word exists, otherwise `false`

### Input

The `Trie` instance will have its methods called with various parameters based on these:

- `methods: string[]`: An array of `Trie` method names
- `params: string[]`: An array of strings

`methods[i]` will be called with `params[i]`.

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `word.length` &lt;= 100
- 1 &lt;= `prefix.length` &lt;= 100
- `word` and `prefix` contain only lowercase English letters
- 1 &lt;= `methods.length` &lt;= 1000
