import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given a two-dimensional binary grid `grid` displaying a map where `1`s signify land and `0`s signify water, determine the number of distinct islands.

An island is defined as a group of `1`s connected horizontally or vertically, and is surrounded by `0`s or the edge of the grid. It is assumed that the grid is completely surrounded by water.

### Input

- `grid: number[][]`: A 2D array of where each element is `1` or `0`

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `grid.length`, `grid[i].length` &lt;= 100
- `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`
