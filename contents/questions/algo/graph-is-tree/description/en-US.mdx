title: Is the Graph a Tree
excerpt: Implement a function to determine if a graph is a valid tree

Consider a graph with `num` nodes, labeled from `0` to `num - 1`. Given `num` and a list of edges where each `edges[i] = [a, b]` represents an undirected connection between nodes `a` and `b`, determine whether the provided edges form a valid tree.

A **[valid tree](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(abstract_data_type)>)** is a connected, acyclic graph that spans all `num` nodes. This means:

1. All nodes must be reachable from any other node
1. The graph must not contain any cycles
1. The graph must have exactly `num - 1` edges, where `num` is the number of nodes

Return `true` if the edges form a valid tree; otherwise, return `false`.

### Input

- `num: number`: Number of nodes in the graph
- `edges: Array<[number, number]>`: A 2D array where `edges[i] = [a, b]` represents an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `num` &lt;= 1000
- 1 &lt;= `edges.length` &lt;= 1000
- `edges[i].length` == 2
- 0 &lt;= `a`, `b` &lt; `num`
- `a != b`
- There are no self-loops or repeated edges
