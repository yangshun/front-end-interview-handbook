title: Balanced Brackets
excerpt: Implement a function to determine if a string contains balanced brackets
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given a string `str` consisting of characters such as `'(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'`, determine if the input string is properly balanced.

A string is considered balanced if:

- Each opening bracket is closed by the same type of bracket (e.g., `(` with `)`, `{` with `}`, and `[` with `]`)
- Open brackets are closed in the correct order (e.g., `([])` is valid, but `([)]` is not)
- Any subset of brackets enclosed within a matched pair must also form a valid matched pair (e.g., `{[(])}` is not balanced because the contents inside `{` and `}` are unbalanced).

### Input

- `str: string`: A string

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `strs.length` &lt;= 1000
- The string `str` contains only the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[` and `]`
