title: Binary Tree Serialization and Deserialization
excerpt: Implement a function to serialize and deserialize a binary tree
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Design a method to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There are no specific constraints on how the serialization and deserialization should be implemented; the key requirement is that the serialized binary tree must be convertible back into the original tree structure.

The binary tree is represented by a collection of `TreeNode`s, where each node has optional `left` and `right` child nodes, which are also `TreeNode`s.

A `TreeNode` has the following interface:

```ts
interface TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

### Input

#### `serializeBinaryTree`

- `root: TreeNode`: Root node of the tree. Examples display a [level-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) of the tree

#### `deserializeBinaryTree`

- `data: string`: String representation of the tree. The format is up to you to design

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= Number of nodes &lt;= 10,000
- 1 &lt;= `TreeNode.val` &lt;= 1,000,000
