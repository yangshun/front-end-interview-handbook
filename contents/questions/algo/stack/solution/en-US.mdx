## Solution

### Array-based solution

The stack abstract data type can be easily implement in JavaScript with JavaScript `Array`s. The main thing to note when implementing stacks is that that the operations should be O(1). Thankfully, JavaScript `Array`'s `push()` and `pop()` operations are O(1) and the method signatures match the `Stack`'s. Many of the methods are just simple wrappers around `Array` methods.

### Linked list-based solution

Stacks can also be implemented with singly-linked lists which are essentially a chain of connected nodes. To do that, we need to create a `Node` class that has a `prev` pointer, a reference to the `Node` below if it's not the bottom item of the stack.

`push()`-ing involves creating a new `Node` and pointing the current top of the stack to that new `Node`'s `prev` field and updating a reference to the new top of the stack. `pop()`-ing is the reverse where we find the `prev` node of the current top and set it to be the new top of the stack.

Since the time complexity of `length()` has to be O(1) and counting the number of items in a linked list will take O(n), we need to separately track the number of items in the list with a `_length` instance property and update it within the `push()` and `pop()` methods.

## Edge cases

- Calling `pop()` on empty stacks.
- Calling `peek()` on empty stacks.

## Techniques

- Familiarity with JavaScript arrays.
- Object-oriented programming.
