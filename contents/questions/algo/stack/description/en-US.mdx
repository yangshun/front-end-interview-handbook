title: Stack
excerpt: Implement a stack data structure containing the common stack methods
---

Implement a stack data structure in JavaScript that contains the following operations:

- `new Stack()`: Creates an instance of a `Stack` class that doesn't contain any items. The constructor does not accept any arguments.
- `push()`: Pushes an item onto the top of the stack and returns the new length of the stack. Required time complexity: O(1).
- `pop()`: Removes an item at the top of the stack and returns that item. Required time complexity: O(1).
- `isEmpty()`: Determines if the stack is empty. Required time complexity: O(1).
- `peek()`: Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it from the stack. Required time complexity: O(1).
- `length()`: Returns the number of items in the stack. Required time complexity: O(1).

## Examples

```js
const stack = new Stack();
stack.isEmpty(); // true
stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);
stack.length(); // 2
stack.push(3);
stack.peek(); // 3
stack.pop(); // 3
stack.isEmpty(); // false
```
