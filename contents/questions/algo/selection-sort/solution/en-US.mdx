Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that works great for small arrays, or arrays which are largely already sorted.

It has a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>), which means that it is discouraged for sorting large arrays. It is not generally used in practice.

## Clarification Questions

If unspecified:

- Should the data be sorted in an ascending or descending order?
- Should the data be sorted in-place or is it acceptable to use additional data structures?
- What kinds of inputs do we need to handle?
  - Will it just be an array of integers or should we handle other data types?
  - Are there a large number of duplicate elements?
  - How should negative numbers be handled?

## Solution

Note: This question tackles sorting for an output in ascending order. Refer to the 'Notes' section below on how to handle other cases.

## Edge Cases

- Non-integer element input: If the input array comprises of elements of different data types, you may need to return an error, settle for sorting on a best-effort basis, for e.g., only sorting a subset of the input data, or even define custom comparison functions for non-integers.
- Single element / Empty input: Either return the original data structure, raise an error, or clarify required handling.
- Already sorted input: You may want to detect sorting and return the input unchanged.
- Duplicate elements: Especially if the array has a large number of duplicate elements, you may want to further optimize your implementation to avoid unnecessary comparisons.
- Invalid input: If the input is not an array, consider throwing an error.

## Notes

- If asked to sort in descending order, change the comparison to find `maxIndex` instead of `minIndex`, by using `>=` instead of `<`, in the relevant comparison as per below:

```js
if (arr[j] >= arr[maxIndex]) {
  maxIndex = j;
}
```

- If asked to use additional data structures or to write a pure function rather than sorting the data in-place, use a spread operator to create a new array before applying the sort.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of selection sort is O(n<sup>2</sup>) - the same in all cases. This can be derived by observing the number of loops. There are 2 loops so the complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>).

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of selection sort is O(1) when performed in-place, as it only requires a constant amount of extra space for storing variables.

However, if the sorting algorithm is not performed in-place, the space complexity would be O(n) as additional memory would be required to store the sorted elements.
