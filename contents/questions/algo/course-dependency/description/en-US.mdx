title: Course Dependency
excerpt: Implement a function to check if all courses can be completed given prerequisites
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

There are a set of courses numbered from `0` to `courses - 1`. Each course may have prerequisites that dictate the order in which the courses must be taken. These prerequisites are given as a list of pairs, where each pair `[a, b]` indicates that course `b` must be completed before course `a`.

Determine if it is possible to complete all courses without violating any prerequisite constraints. Return `true` if it is possible to complete all the courses; otherwise, return `false`.

### Input

- `courses: number`: An integer representing the total number of courses
- `prerequisites: Array<[number, number]>`: A 2D array where each element `[a, b]` indicates that course `b` is a prerequisite for course `a`

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `courses` &lt;= 1000
- 0 &lt;= `prerequisites.length` &lt;= 1000
- `prerequisites[i].length` == 2
- 0 &lt;= `a`, `b` &lt; courses
- All pairs `[a, b]` in `prerequisites` are unique
