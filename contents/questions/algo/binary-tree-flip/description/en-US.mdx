title: Flip Binary Tree
excerpt: Implement a function to flip the nodes in a binary tree
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given the `root` node of a binary tree, flip the tree by swapping each node's left and right children, then return the root of the flipped tree.

The binary tree is represented by a collection of `TreeNode`s, where each node has optional `left` and `right` child nodes, which are also `TreeNode`s.

A `TreeNode` has the following interface:

```ts
interface TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

### Input

- `root: TreeNode`: Root node of the tree. Examples display a [level-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) of the tree

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= Number of nodes &lt;= 100
- -100 &lt;= `TreeNode.val` &lt;= 100
