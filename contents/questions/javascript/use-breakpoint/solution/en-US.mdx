import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import useBreakpoint from '../setup/src/use-breakpoint';

## Solution

The `useBreakpoint` hook can be implemented in `createBreakpoint` using the `useState` hook to store the current window width and the `useEffect` hook to update the width when the window is resized.

After which, sort the breakpoints by increasing values, then search for the last breakpoint whose minimum width is less than the current window width.

If you're using TypeScript, you can make the `createBreakpoint` function generic so that the returned `useBreakpoint`'s return type is only the strings of the keys of the given `breakpoints` object, ensuring maximum typesafety.

<MDXCodeBlock>{useBreakpoint}</MDXCodeBlock>
