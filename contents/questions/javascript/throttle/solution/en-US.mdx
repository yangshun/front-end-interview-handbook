Throttle, along with [debounce](/questions/javascript/debounce), are among the most common front end interview questions; it's the front end equivalent of inverting a binary tree. Hence you should make sure that you are very familiar with both questions.

## Solution

A throttled function can be in two states: it's either:

- **Idle**: The throttled function was not invoked in the last `wait` duration. Calling the throttled function will immediately execute the callback function without any need to throttle. After this happens, the function enters the "Active" state.
- **Active**: The throttled function was invoked within the last `wait` duration. Subsequent calls should not execute the callback function until `wait` is over.

Given that there's a `wait` duration before the function can be invoked again, we know that we will need a timer, and `setTimeout` is the first thing that comes to mind. Since there are only two states, we can use a `boolean` variable to model the state.

We will also need to return a function which contains logic surrounding when to invoke the `func`. This function needs to do a few things:

### 1. Throttle invocation

The callback function is invoked immediately and doesn't allow only invocations again until a duration of `wait` has passed. As mentioned earlier, we can use a boolean variable `shouldThrottle` to model the states.

When the function is called in the "Idle" state, a few things are done:

1. `shouldThrottle` is set to `true`. The function is now in the "Active" state.
1. Invoke `func` with the appropriate arguments.
1. Use `setTimeout` to schedule releasing of the lock (`shouldThrottle = false`) after `wait` duration.

While the lock is active, calls to the throttled function will not invoke `func` because of the `shouldThrottle` check at the top of the function.

### 2. Invoke `func` with the appropriate arguments

Throttled functions are used like the original functions, so we should forward the value of `this` and function arguments when invoking the original callback functions.

Invoking the original callback function `func` has to preserve the reference to `this`. Therefore:

- Arrow functions cannot be used to declare the inner function due to lexical binding of `this`.
- Invoking the original callback function via `func(...args)` will not forward the correct `this` reference and cannot be used.

Hence we have to use `Function.prototype.apply()`/`Function.prototype.call()` which allows us to specify `this` as the first argument:

- `func.apply(thisArg, args)`
- `func.call(thisArg, ...args)`

Note that there are many variations of `throttle` and this implementation only covers the most common behavior. Some other variations:

1. Have `leading` and `trailing` options, including methods to `flush` and `cancel` delayed `func` invocations, like [Lodash's `_.throttle`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#throttle).
1. Collect all the throttled invocations and spread them out by executing them at every `wait` intervals in the future, respecting the rule that there can only be at most one invocation every `wait` duration. In contrast, this current implementation ignores all throttled function invocations when the lock is active.

## Techniques

- Using `setTimeout`.
- Closures.
- How `this` works.
- Invoking functions via `Function.prototype.apply()`/`Function.prototype.call()`.
