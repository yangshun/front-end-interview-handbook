title: Debounce II
excerpt: Implement a debounce function that comes with a cancel method to cancel delayed invocations and a flush method to immediately invoke them

**Note:** This is an advanced version of [Debounce](/questions/javascript/debounce), you should complete that first before attempting this question.

Debouncing is a technique used to control how many times we allow a function to be executed over time. When a JavaScript function is debounced with a wait time of X milliseconds, it must wait until after X milliseconds have elapsed since the debounced function was last called.

You almost certainly have encountered debouncing in your daily lives before (e.g. when entering an elevator). Only after X duration of not pressing the "Door open" button (the debounced function not being called) will the elevator door actually close (the callback function is executed).

Implement a `debounce` function which accepts a callback function and a `wait` duration. Calling `debounce()` returns a function which has debounced invocations of the callback function following the behavior described above.

Additionally, the debounce-ed function comes with two extra methods:

1. `cancel()` method to cancel pending invocations
2. `flush()` method to immediately invoke any delayed invocations

## Examples

```js
let i = 0;
function increment() {
  i++;
}
const debouncedIncrement = debounce(increment, 100);

// t = 0: Call debouncedIncrement().
debouncedIncrement(); // i = 0

// t = 50: Cancel the delayed increment.
debouncedIncrement.cancel();

// t = 100: increment() was not invoked and i is still 0.
```

Flushing to instantly call the debounced function.

```js
let i = 0;
function increment() {
  i++;
}
const debouncedIncrement = debounce(increment, 100);

// t = 0: Call debouncedIncrement().
debouncedIncrement(); // i = 0

// t = 50: i is still 0 because 100ms have not passed.
// t = 51:
debouncedIncrement.flush(); // i is now 1 because flush causes() the callback to be immediately invoked.

// t = 100: i is already 1. The callback has been called before
// and won't be called again.
```

**Note:** Due to the use of delays in the tests for this question, tests can take a while to complete execution.
