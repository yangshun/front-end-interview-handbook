title: Promise.race
excerpt: Implement the Promise.race() function that resolves or rejects when any of the input elements are resolved or rejected
---

> The `Promise.race()` method returns a promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the promises in an iterable fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise.

> If the iterable passed is empty, the promise returned will be forever pending.

> If the iterable contains one or more non-promise value and/or an already settled promise, then `Promise.race()` will resolve to the first of these values found in the iterable.

Let's implement our own version of `Promise.race()`, a `promiseRace` function, with the difference being the function takes in an array instead of an iterable. Be sure to read the description carefully and implement accordingly!

## Examples

```js
const p0 = new Promise((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve(42);
  }, 100);
});
const p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    reject('Err!');
  }, 400);
});

await promiseRace([p0, p1]); // 42
```

```js
const p0 = Promise.resolve(42);
const p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve(21);
  }, 100);
});

await promiseRace([p0, p1]); // 42
```

```js
const p0 = new Promise((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve(42);
  }, 400);
});
const p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    reject('Err!');
  }, 100);
});

try {
  await promiseRace([p0, p1]);
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err); // 'Err!'
}
```
