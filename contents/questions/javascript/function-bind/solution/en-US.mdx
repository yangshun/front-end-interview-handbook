This question asks us to implement the `Function.prototype.bind` method, which should behave exactly like the native one. It is a common practice to implement modern, shiny new additions to JavaScript using older, more mature language features so that these APIs can still be used on older browsers. This practice is called [polyfilling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill).

However, writing polyfills that are faithful to the specification and fully compatible with legacy browsers is not an easy task. It is unrealistic to be expected to write one in interview settings. For this question, the interviewers are typically more interested in your familiarity with the native `bind` method and the `this` keyword.

## Clarification questions

- Can I use other related native methods such `Function.prototype.apply` and `Function.prototype.call`?
  - Yes, you may.
- Can I use other modern JavaScript features?
  - Yes, as long as you do not use `Function.prototype.bind`.

## A refresher on `Function.prototype.bind` and `this`

The native `bind` is a method on `Function.prototype`, so every function you declare in your program automatically inherits such a method from the prototype chain.

One common use case for `bind` is to preserve the binding of a method when called as a function. A method call is a function on an object that is being called. For example:

```jsx
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  getName() {
    return this.name;
  },
};

person.getName(); // 'John'
```

In a method call, `this` is implicitly bound to the object that is calling it. Object here refers generally to either a plain old JavaScript object or a function (as we will see later).

```jsx
person.getName(); // In this case the `this` bound to the method call `getName()` is `person`.
```

However that's not the case for function calls. A function call is different in that it doesn't get invoked on an object.

For example, we can assign `person.getName` to another variable so it contains a reference to the same function as `person.getName`:

```jsx
const getName = person.getName;
const name = getName(); // In strict mode, this raises a TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
```

When the same method is called as a function call, there is no implicit binding, thus resulting in `this` bound to the global object (in non-strict mode) or an error being thrown (in strict mode).

This is where `bind` comes in handy - we can preserve the context of the method call to `person` via `person.getName.bind(person)`:

```jsx
const getName = person.getName.bind(person);
const name = getName(); // 'John'
```

If you found this confusing, it is normal. `this` is arguably one of the bad parts about JavaScript, as unlike everything else which is statically bound, only `this` is dynamically bound, which means that the caller of the function, not the maker of the function, determines its binding. This deviation is a source of confusion.

Another use case for `bind` is to create partially applied functions with pre-specified initial arguments. Check out [the MDN's section on "Partially applied functions"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind#partially_applied_functions) if you need a refresher.

Now that we understand how `bind` works and its use case, let's try to implement it.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Using `call`/`apply`

Firstly, since the native `bind` is on `Function.prototype`, our `bind` also has to be on it. We'll implement it as `Function.prototype.myBind`.

```jsx
Function.prototype.myBind = function () {
  // Implementation goes here...
};
```

Secondly, the arguments `Function.prototype.myBind` accepts should be identical to the native one, where the first argument is the `this` keyword that the target function is bound to, after that it takes a variadic list of arguments to prepend to the arguments of the bound function.

Next, it returns a new function, with its `this` bound to the previous context passed to `Function.prototype.myBind` method. When the returned function is invoked, it gets the prepended arguments passed from `Function.prototype.myBind` as well.

How do we refer to the original method that `bind` is called upon in the new returned function? Turns out we can access it via `this` inside `Function.prototype.myBind`, as `Function.prototype.myBind` is invoked as a method call, thus resulting in its `this` bound to the method `foo` implicitly.

```jsx
person.getAge.myBind(person); // myBind is a method call and its `this` is bound implicitly to the method `getAge`
```

Lastly, we can use [`Function.prototype.call`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call) or [`Function.prototype.apply`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply) inside the returned function, to call the original method with the `thisArg` passed to the `myBind` method.

### Approach 2: Using `Reflect`

Another thing we need to watch out for: we invoke `apply` directly on `originalFunc`. While this is fine most of the time but it does impose a reliability hazard in rare cases. Because of how the property resolution mechanism works in JavaScript, if `originalFunc` contains a user-defined method/property with the same name `call`, that shadows `Function.prototype.call`. As a result, it is the user-defined `apply` that (if it exists on `originalFunc`) gets called.

To make our code more robust, we need to be more explicit here. We can either

- Call `apply` via `Function.prototype.call`: [`Function.prototype.apply.call`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply) as in `Function.prototype.apply.call(originalFunc, context, [...argArray, ...args])`.
- Use [`Reflect.apply()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect/apply#description): A lesser known API added to JavaScript in ES6 to call a target function with arguments as specified.

Here is the robust solution:

<MDXCodeBlock>{functionBindReflect}</MDXCodeBlock>

### Approach 3: Using `Symbol`

Another approach is to create a `Symbol` and add it as a property to a newly-created `Object` with `thisArg` bound to it.

<MDXCodeBlock>{functionBindSymbol}</MDXCodeBlock>

## Edge cases

There are still some edge cases with this current solution if we dig deep enough:

- We didn't cover the use case where bound functions can be used as constructors with the new operator. This usage rarely comes up in modern web development and should be considered an obscure corner of the language. Check out [this MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind#bound_functions_used_as_constructors) if you are interested in this peculiar behavior of `bind`.
- Note that `bind` is an ES5 feature. Realistically speaking, if we were to write a bind polyfill, we can't use any features introduced after ES4; otherwise it defeats the purpose because our polyfill with ES5+ features would break on legacy browsers anyway. However, our solution uses the `const` keyword, the rest operator `...`, and `Reflect`, which are all ES6 features. Refer to [this implementation](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/blob/master/packages/core-js/internals/function-bind.js) from `core-js` if you are interested in seeing how the polyfill of `bind` is implemented.
