title: Data Selection
excerpt: Implement a function to filter rows of data matching a specified requirement
---

A data set of gym sessions looks like this:

```js
[
  { user: 8, duration: 50, equipment: ['bench'] },
  { user: 7, duration: 150, equipment: ['dumbbell', 'kettlebell'] },
  { user: 1, duration: 10, equipment: ['barbell'] },
  { user: 7, duration: 100, equipment: ['bike', 'kettlebell'] },
  { user: 7, duration: 200, equipment: ['bike'] },
  { user: 2, duration: 200, equipment: ['treadmill'] },
  { user: 2, duration: 200, equipment: ['bike'] },
];
```

Each session has the following fields:

- `user`: User ID of the session's user.
- `duration`: Duration of the session, in minutes.
- `equipment`: Array of equipment used during the sessions, in alphabetical order. There are only 5 different equipments.

Implement a method `selectData`, which is used to return sessions from the data. It has the interface `selectData(sessions [, options])`. The options available should include:

- `user`: Select only sessions with this `id`. If not specified, include all users (subject to other filters).
- `minDuration`: Select only sessions with `duration` equal to or greater than this value. If not specified, include all sessions regardless of duration (subject to other filters).
- `equipment`: Select only sessions where at least one of the specified equipments were used. If not specified, include all sessions regardless of equipment used (subject to other filters).
- `merge`: If set to `true`
  - Sessions from the same `user` should be merged into one object. When merging:
    - Sum up the `duration` fields.
    - Combine all the `equipment` used, de-duplicating the values and sorting alphabetically.
  - The other filter options should be applied to the merged data.

Note:

- The order of the results should always remain unchanged from the original set.
- In the case of merging user sessions, the row should take the place of the **latest** occurrence of that `user`.
- The input objects should not be modified.

## Examples

The following examples use the data set above:

```js
selectData(sessions);
// [
//   { user: 8, duration: 50, equipment: ['bench'] },
//   { user: 7, duration: 150, equipment: ['dumbbell', 'kettlebell'] },
//   { user: 1, duration: 10, equipment: ['barbell'] },
//   { user: 7, duration: 100, equipment: ['bike', 'kettlebell'] },
//   { user: 7, duration: 200, equipment: ['bike'] },
//   { user: 2, duration: 200, equipment: ['treadmill'] },
//   { user: 2, duration: 200, equipment: ['bike'] },
// ];

selectData(sessions, { user: 2 });
// [
//   { user: 2, duration: 200, equipment: ['treadmill'] },
//   { user: 2, duration: 200, equipment: ['bike'] },
// ];

selectData(sessions, { minDuration: 200 });
// [
//   { user: 7, duration: 200, equipment: ['bike'] },
//   { user: 2, duration: 200, equipment: ['treadmill'] },
//   { user: 2, duration: 200, equipment: ['bike'] },
// ];

selectData(sessions, { minDuration: 400 });
// [];

selectData(sessions, { equipment: ['bike', 'dumbbell'] });
// [
//   { user: 7, duration: 150, equipment: ['dumbbell', 'kettlebell'] },
//   { user: 7, duration: 100, equipment: ['bike', 'kettlebell'] },
//   { user: 7, duration: 200, equipment: ['bike'] },
//   { user: 2, duration: 200, equipment: ['bike'] },
// ];

selectData(sessions, { merge: true });
// [
//   { user: 8, duration: 50, equipment: ['bench'] },
//   { user: 1, duration: 10, equipment: ['barbell'] },
//   { user: 7, duration: 450, equipment: ['bike', 'dumbbell', 'kettlebell'] },
//   { user: 2, duration: 400, equipment: ['bike', 'treadmill'] },
// ];

selectData(sessions, { merge: true, minDuration: 400 });
// [
//   { user: 7, duration: 450, equipment: ['bike', 'dumbbell', 'kettlebell'] },
//   { user: 2, duration: 400, equipment: ['bike', 'treadmill'] },
// ];
```
