## Solution

The goal is to create a function that takes an array and a predicate function. We must remove elements from the **start** of the original array as long as the predicate function returns `true` when called with `(value, index, array)`. The removal stops as soon as the predicate returns `false` for an element encountered while iterating from **left to right**. We must return a new array containing the remaining elements (from the stopping point onwards), and the original array must not be modified.

## Algorithm

The most straightforward approach is to iterate through the array from **left to right** (starting at index 0), finding the index of the first element for which the predicate returns a falsey value. Once this index is found, we know that all elements **before** this index should be dropped. We can then use `Array.prototype.slice()` to create a new array containing elements **from this index to the end** of the array.
