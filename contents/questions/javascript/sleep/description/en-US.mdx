title: Sleep
excerpt: Implement a function that pauses for a specified duration before resuming execution
---

In JavaScript, the `setTimeout` function can be used to execute callbacks after a delay. However, it introduces a layer of nesting in the code which may not be desired. It'd be nice to use `setTimeout` in this fashion:

```js
// Note: the following code contains invalid syntax and doesn't work.
console.log('Hello!');
setTimeout(1000);
console.log('Bye.');
```

In languages like Java and Python, a `sleep` function is available to suspend execution of the calling thread. However, unlike other languages, JavaScript is single-threaded and blocking the main thread is not a good idea. Hence lets implement an **asynchronous** version of the `sleep` function that works similarly but does not block the main thread.

## Examples

```js
async function greeting() {
  console.log('Hello!');
  await sleep(2000);
  console.log('Bye.'); // Only logs after 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds)
}

greeting();
// t = 0: Hello!
// t = 2000: Bye.
```

The `sleep` function should also be able to be used without `await`:

```js
console.log('Hello!');
sleep(2000).then(() => {
  console.log('Bye.'); // Only logs after 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds)
});
```
