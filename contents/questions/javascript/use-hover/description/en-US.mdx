Implement a `useHover` hook that tracks whether an element is being hovered.

```jsx
export default function Component() {
  const [ref, hovered] = useHover();

  return (
    <div>
      <div ref={ref}>{hovered ? 'Hovered' : 'Not hovered'}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Arguments

Nothing.

## Returns

The hook returns an array with two elements:

1. A ref callback function that will be attached to the `ref` prop of the element to track. This has the type `(element: T | null) => void`, where `T` extends `Element`
2. A `boolean` that indicates whether the element is currently being hovered
