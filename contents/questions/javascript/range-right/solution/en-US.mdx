## Solution

### Approach 1: Use `unshift()` to push elements from the front of the `result` array

Here is a solution that generates the range of sequence from `start` to (but not including) `end` with `step` as increment using `unshift()` instead of `push()`. Overloaded functions are required in TypeScript as `start` and `step` are optional.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: rangeRightJs, tsx: rangeRightTs }} />

### Approach 2: Insert elements from the back normally, but reverse the final `result` array

However, since `unshift()` has a time complexity of O(N), here is a more efficient solution that reverses the result array after pushing the values into the array normally.

<MDXCodeBlock
  languages={{ jsx: rangeRightReverseJs, tsx: rangeRightReverseTs }}
/>

## Edge cases

To handle cases where `start` and `step` are not specified but `end` is negative, we can add an if statement to change the value of `step` to -1.
