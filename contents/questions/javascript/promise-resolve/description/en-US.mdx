excerpt: Implement a function to resolve a given value to a Promise
---

The `Promise.resolve()` static method "resolves" a given value to a `Promise`. If the value is:

- A native promise, return that promise.
- A non-thenable, return a promise that is already fulfilled with that value.
- A thenable, `Promise.resolve()` will call the `then()` method and pass a pair of resolving functions as arguments. A promise that has the same state as the thenable is returned.

A "thenable" is an interface that implements the `.then()` method, which is called with two callbacks: one for when the promise is fulfilled, one for when it's rejected. Promises are also thenables.

Implement the `Promise.resolve()` function as `promiseResolve`. You can ignore the case where `this` is referenced within the implemented function.

## Examples

Resolving a non-promise.

```js
const p = promiseResolve(42);
await p; // 42
```

Resolving a `Promise`.

```js
const original = new Promise((resolve) => resolve(42));
const cast = promiseResolve(original);
await cast; // 42
```

Resolving a thenable.

```js
const resolvedThenable = promiseResolve({
  then(resolve, reject) {
    resolve(42);
  },
});
await resolvedThenable; // 42
```
