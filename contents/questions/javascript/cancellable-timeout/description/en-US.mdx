title: Cancellable Timeout
excerpt: Implement a function that acts like setTimeout but returns a function to cancel the pending callback
---

Implement a function `setCancellableTimeout`, that acts like `setTimeout` but instead of returning a timer ID, it returns a function that when called, cancels the pending callback function. The `setCancellableTimeout` function should have the exact same signature as `setTimeout`:

```js
setCancellableTimeout(callback);
setCancellableTimeout(callback, delay);
setCancellableTimeout(callback, delay, param1);
setCancellableTimeout(callback, delay, param1, param2);
setCancellableTimeout(callback, delay, param1, param2, /* â€¦ ,*/ paramN);
```

You are recommended to read up on for `setTimeout` on [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) if you are unfamiliar.

## Examples

```js
let i = 0;
// t = 0:
const cancel = setCancellableTimeout(() => {
  i++;
}, 100);
// t = 50:
cancel();
// t = 100: i is still 0 because cancel() was called.
```
