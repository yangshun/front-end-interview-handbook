title: Array.prototype.map
excerpt: Implement the Array.prototype.map() method
---

`Array.prototype.map` creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Implement `Array.prototype.map`. To avoid overwriting the actual `Array.prototype.map` which is being used by the autograder, we shall instead implement it as `Array.prototype.myMap`.

## Examples

```js
[1, 2, 3, 4].myMap((i) => i); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4].myMap((i) => i * i); // [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

## Notes

The map callback function takes in more than just the element! There's also a second parameter for `Array.prototype.map` as well. You are recommended to read the specification for `Array.prototype.map` on [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) before attempting.
