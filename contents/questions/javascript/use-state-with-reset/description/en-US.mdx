Implement a `useStateWithReset` hook that's similar to `useState` but with an additional `reset` function that resets the state to its initial value.

```jsx
export default function Component() {
  const [value, setValue, resetValue] = useStateWithReset(10);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Value: {value}</div>
      <input onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={resetValue}>reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Arguments

- `initialValue`: the initial value of the state. This argument should be the same as the first argument of the `useState` hook

## Returns

The `useStateWithReset` hook should have the same return values as the `useState` hook, plus an additional function that resets the state to `initialValue`
