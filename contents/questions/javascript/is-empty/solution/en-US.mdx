import isEmptyJs from '../setup/src/is-empty.js';
import isEmptyTs from '../setup/src/is-empty.ts';

## Solution

The important part of this question is to be aware of how to check for each type of data and how to determine whether it's empty.

The order of checking isn't too important, but `Object` is a base type for many JavaScript values (`null`, `Array`s are all objects), so it is best to check for plain objects at the last.

Note that Lodash's implementation of `isEmpty` also checks for less common data types like `arguments` objects and DOM collections but we've excluded that from the solution.
