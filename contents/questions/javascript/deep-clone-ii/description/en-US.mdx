title: Deep Clone II
excerpt: Implement a function that performs a deep copy of a value, but also handles circular references
---

**Note:** This is an advanced version of the [Deep Clone](/questions/javascript/deep-clone) question, which you should complete first before attempting this question.

It is not realistic to expect candidates to produce a complete deep clone solution in typical interview settings, though the interviewer might ask you a simple version a la [Deep Clone](/questions/javascript/deep-clone) and engage you in a discussion regarding the edge cases and how you would handle them.

Implement a `deepClone` function that performs a deep clone as thoroughly as possible, while also handling the following:

- The input object can contain any data type.
- Handle the edge case where the input object is cyclic, i.e. the circular references should also be cloned.

## Examples

```js
const obj1 = {
  num: 0,
  str: '',
  boolean: true,
  unf: undefined,
  nul: null,
  obj: { name: 'foo', id: 1 },
  arr: [0, 1, 2],
  date: new Date(),
  reg: new RegExp('/bar/ig'),
  [Symbol('s')]: 'baz',
};

const clonedObj1 = deepClone(obj1);
clonedObj1.arr.push(3);
obj1.arr; // Should still be [0, 1, 2]

const obj2 = { a: {} };
obj2.a.b = obj2; // Circular reference

const clonedObj2 = deepClone(obj2); // Should not cause a stack overflow by recursing into an infinite loop.

clonedObj2.a.b = 'something new';

obj2.a.b === obj2; // This should still be true
```
