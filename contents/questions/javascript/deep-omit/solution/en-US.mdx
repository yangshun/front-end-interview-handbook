## Clarification questions

- Can there be values like `Date`, `Symbol`, `RegExp` within the objects?
  - Yes, there can be.
- Should we recurse into `Map`s and `Set`s?
  - To keep the question simple, no. There are no tests cases containing `Map`s and `Set`s but you are free to add support if you wish.

## Solution

Since the input value can be deeply nested, a recursive solution will be handy for traversing the nested values. The idea is to recursively visit all values in the input, iterating through array items and object entries, filtering out object entries where keys are within the `keys` parameter.

Since arrays and objects need special handling, there are three categories of values we need to handle:

1. **Arrays**: Use `Array.isArray()` to check for this type. Iterate through the array and return a new array of each element after mapping with `deepOmit()`.
1. **Objects**: A helper function `isPlainObject()` (from [Type Utilities II](/questions/javascript/type-utilities-ii)) is used to check for plain object types. Doing `typeof element === 'object' && element !== null` won't work because there are other values like `Date` and `Set` that will pass the check. Iterate through the keys of the object, filter out keys that are within `keys`, recursively call `deepOmit` on the values, for non-omitted keys, adding the return values to `newObj`.
1. **Others**: This is the base case for the recursion and we can return the value directly since we don't need to recurse into it.

Both arrays and objects can be iterated using `for...in` loops. A shorter version is as follows. This is safe because the `keys` inputs are strings and will not match the array keys, which are integers. However, writing it this way is not recommended as the code becomes harder to understand. It also becomes more challenging to write a typesafe version if you are using TypeScript.
