title: Text Search II
excerpt: Implement a function to highlight text if searched terms appear within it
---

In browsers, we are able to find specific words or phrases within a webpage by using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (Windows, Linux) or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (Mac) and entering the search term. Matches which appear will be highlighted in yellow.

Let's implement a simple version of a browser's in-webpage search with the difference being we're given a string (as opposed to HTML) and search matches appear **bolded**.

Given a string and an array of queries, implement a function `textSearch` that finds all case-insensitive matches from the `queries` array within the string, wrapping the matches in `<b>...</b>` tags.

## Examples

```js
textSearch('The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog', ['fox']);
// 'The Quick Brown <b>Fox</b> Jumps Over The Lazy Dog'
textSearch('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', ['fox', 'dog']);
// 'The quick brown <b>fox</b> jumps over the lazy <b>dog</b>'
```

If two such queries overlap or are consecutive, they should be wrapped in a single pair of `<b>` tags.

```js
textSearch('This is Uncopyrightable!', ['copy', 'right']);
// 'This is Un<b>copyright</b>able!'
textSearch('This is Uncopyrightable!', ['copy', 'right', 'table']);
// 'This is Un<b>copyrightable</b>!'
```

A character will not match the same query more than once, with earlier letters taking priority.

```js
textSearch('aaa', ['aa']);
// '<b>aa</b>a'
// This is because the second character cannot be used as a match again.
textSearch('aaaa', ['aa']);
// '<b>aaaa</b>'
```

You can assume there are no duplicate strings in the `queries` array.
