This question evaluates one's ability to manipulate arrays and strings in JavaScript, which is certainly an essential skill for Front End development.

## Clarification questions

Your interviewer might not necessarily spell out all the requirements for you upfront. Ideally you start by thinking about all the possible situations and edge cases.

- What if the `queries` array is an empty array? Or the input string `text` is an empty string?
  - Return the string as-is.
- What if any `query` inside the `queries` array is an empty string?
  - Skip that query.

## Solution

One might think of leveraging regular expressions (regex), via `RegExp`. Regex is very hard to use here but because the characters within the string can match multiple queries. There are ways to get around that but it's non-trivial.

One idea is to process one query at a time, adding the `<b>` tag for the current query, but this will ruin the string for subsequent queries. Imagine this scenario:

```js
textSearch('aaabc', ['aaa', 'abc']);
```

After processing `'aaa'`, the string is now `<b>aaa</b>bc`, which won't match `'abc'`. Hence this approach is not feasible too.

### Working backwards

Let's try to think backwards from the desired output: we want to output a string with the substrings that exist in the `queries` array wrapped in `<b>` tags. Therefore we need to know where exactly to insert the opening `<b>` tags and closing `</b>` tags. We can create a boolean array of same length as the `text` with every value defaulting to `false`. The value of `boldChars[index]` indicates whether the character at that index in the original string needs to be bold.

```js
// #1: Basic case.
// text: "aaabcaa", queries: ['abc']
// boldChars: [false, false, true, true, true, false, false]
// result: "aa<b>abc</b>aa"

// #2: Non-overlapping case.
// text: "aaabcaabc", queries: ['abc']
// boldChars: [false, false, true, true, true, false, true, true, true]
// result: "aa<b>abc</b>a<b>abc</b>"

// #3: Overlapping case.
// text: "baabcaa", queries: ['abc', 'aa']
// boldChars: [false, true, true, true, true, true true]
// result: "a<b>aabcaa</b>"
```

The beginning of a span of consecutive chunks of `true` is where we insert the opening tag `<b>` and the end is where we add a closing `</b>`.

To identify which characters need to be bold, we do a naive substring match at each character in `text` for each query. Flipping the boolean value at each matching character's index to `true`. However, because of the "one character can only match the same query once" condition, we have to increment `i` to go past the current query when there's a match.

## Notes

- We use `Array.prototype.fill()` to mutate the boolean array conveniently when we find a substring match. The method `fill` is one of the few methods that mutate arrays. As of writing, there are 9 methods in total that mutates arrays: `pop`, `push`, `reverse`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, `unshift`, `copyWithin` and `fill`. Check out [Does it mutate](https://doesitmutate.xyz) where there is a nice list of mutating array methods with more details.
