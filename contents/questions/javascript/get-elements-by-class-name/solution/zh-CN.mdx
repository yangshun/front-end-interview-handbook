This question assesses you on the basic DOM traversal APIs, recursion, and knowledge of CSS - how elements are matched according to the element's class name. The approach to solve this question is similar to [getElementsByTagName](/questions/javascript/get-elements-by-tag-name).

## Solution

The solution is pretty straightforward if you are familiar with the HTML DOM APIs. In particular, we need to know the following:

* [`Element.classList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList) which returns a live `DOMTokenList` of class attributes of the element. This is preferred over `className` because `className` is a string and needs to be manually parsed.
* [`Element.children`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/children) which returns a live `HTMLCollection` of the child elements. We use this over `Node.childNodes` which returns a live `NodeList` of child `Node`s because `childNodes` will include non-element nodes like text and comment nodes, which are not relevant in this question.
  * However `HTMLCollection` does not have `.forEach`, so we have to iterate through it using traditional `for` loops.

For the class name to match, they have to be a subset of the `classList` of an element. The matching is also case-sensitive and duplicate class names (in both the input and on the elements) do not matter.

We can maintain an `elements` array to collect the matching elements while recursively traversing the root element. A depth-first traversal is performed.

Remember that the element argument itself is not included in the results.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: getElementsByClassNameJs, tsx: getElementsByClassNameTs }} />

## Edge cases

* Element argument is not included in the results even if it matches the tag name.
* Duplicate class names in both the input and on the element's `class` are ignored.
* Whitespace in input and on the element's `class` are handled properly.
