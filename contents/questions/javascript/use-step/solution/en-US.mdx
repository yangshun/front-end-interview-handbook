import useStep from '../setup/src/use-step';

## Solution

The `useStep` hook can be implemented by storing the step number in a `useState` state and defining the utility methods to manipulate the step number in terms of the state's setter function. We bound the step updates between `1` and `maxStep` to ensure the step number does not go out of bounds.

Remember to wrap the utility methods in `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of the calling component.
