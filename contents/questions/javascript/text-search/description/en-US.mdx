title: Text Search
excerpt: Implement a function to highlight text if a searched term appears within it
---

In browsers, we are able to find specific words or phrases within a webpage by using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (Windows, Linux) or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (Mac) and entering the search term. Matches which appear will be highlighted in yellow.

Let's implement a simple version of a browser's in-webpage search with the difference being we're given a string (as opposed to HTML) and search matches appear **bolded**.

Given a content string and a query string, implement a function `textSearch` that finds all case-insensitive matches with the `query` string, wrapping the matches in `<b>...</b>` tags.

## Examples

```js
textSearch('The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog', 'fox');
// 'The Quick Brown <b>Fox</b> Jumps Over The Lazy Dog'
textSearch('The hardworking Dog overtakes the lazy dog', 'dog');
// 'The hardworking <b>Dog</b> overtakes the lazy <b>dog</b>'
```

A character will not match the same query more than once, with letters appearing earlier taking priority.

```js
textSearch('aaa', 'aa');
// '<b>aa</b>a'
// This is because the second character cannot be used as a match again.
```

Consecutive matches should be combined into a single `<b>` tag.

```js
textSearch('aaaa', 'aa');
// Correct: '<b>aaaa</b>'
// Wrong: '<b>aa</b><b>aa</b>'
```
