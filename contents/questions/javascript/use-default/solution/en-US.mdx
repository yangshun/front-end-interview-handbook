import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import useDefault from '../setup/src/use-default';

## Solution

This hook is very similar to the `useState` hook, but it conditionally returns `defaultValue` as the first element of the returned tuple when the current state `value` is `null` or `undefined`.

<MDXCodeBlock>{useDefault}</MDXCodeBlock>

If you're using TypeScript, this should be a warm up for you to start writing generic functions! To ensure that the inferred return type is a tuple and not just an array of unioned types, use `as const` or provide the explicit return type in the function signature.

## Edge cases

You just have to be careful to not simply check for `!value` since `0` or `false` are also valid values for the state.
