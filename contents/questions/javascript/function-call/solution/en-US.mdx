The `Function.prototype.call()` function is a built-in method in JavaScript that allows you to call a function with a specified this value and a set of arguments, passed individually (not as an array like `Function.prototype.apply`). It allows you to explicitly define the context (`this` value) in which the function will be executed.

## Solution

### Approach 1: Using `bind`

`bind`, `apply`, and `call` can be viewed as sibling functions. They're highly similar in terms of function signature and usage. Within `Function.prototype` methods, `this` refers to the `Function` object itself. If the `this` context is not used at all, the following will work:

```js
Function.prototype.myCall = function (thisArg, ...argArray) {
  return this(...argArray);
};
```

However, `thisArg` is still used widely in modern code, so we need another way to do this. `Function.prototype.bind` creates a new function with a specified `this` value and initial arguments, without executing the original function immediately. It allows you to permanently bind a specific context (`this` value) to the function and partially apply arguments if needed. This is exactly what we need to bridge the gap in the solution above.

Or you can also pass the `argArray` into `bind()` before executing it.

### Approach 2: Using `apply`

`Function.prototype.call` and `Function.prototype.apply` are very similar. Here's an easy way to remember each function's signature:

- `Function.prototype.call` starts with "C" and takes in a **C**omma-separated list of arguments
- `Function.prototype.apply` starts with "A" and takes in an **A**rray of arguments

### Approach 3: Using `Symbol`

Another approach is to create a `Symbol` and add it as a property to a newly-created `Object` with `thisArg` bound to it. This is very similar to one of the solutions to the [`Function.prototype.bind`](/questions/javascript/function-bind) question.
