title: Map Async
excerpt: Implement a function that maps an array of items with an asynchronous mapping function
---

By now you'd be familiar with mapping of elements in an array. If you aren't, please first do the [Array.prototype.map](/questions/javascript/array-map) question first.

What if the mapping function is not a synchronous function i.e. it returns a promise? `Array.prototype.map` assumes the mapping function is synchronous and will fail to work properly.

Implement a function `mapAsync` that accepts an array of items and maps each element with an asynchronous mapping function. The function should return a `Promise` which resolves to the mapped results.

## Examples

```js
const asyncDouble = (x: number) =>
  new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(x * 2);
    }, 10);
  });

const doubled = await mapAsync([1, 2], asyncDouble);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4]
```
