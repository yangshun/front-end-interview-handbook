import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import mapAsyncTs from '../setup/src/map-async.ts';
import mapAsyncPromiseAll from '../setup/src/map-async-promise-all.ts';

## Solution

This question is very similar to the [`Promise.all`](/questions/javascript/promise-all) question and since this question can be reduced to [`Promise.all`](/questions/javascript/promise-all), the same approaches can be used.

### Approach 1: Count unresolved promises

The only difference is that instead of just an array of iterables, you have to map the array yourself using a mapping function, then resolve the mapped results.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: mapAsyncJs, tsx: mapAsyncTs }} />

### Approach 2: `Promise.all`

We can also use `Promise.all` as mapping each item with the mapping function will produce an array of `Promise`s to be resolved.

<MDXCodeBlock>{mapAsyncPromiseAll}</MDXCodeBlock>

## Edge cases

We did not specify what parameters the asynchronous mapping function will be passed, so it is up to you to clarify with the interviewer whether the mapping callback function will be passed additional arguments like in `Array.prototype.map`.
