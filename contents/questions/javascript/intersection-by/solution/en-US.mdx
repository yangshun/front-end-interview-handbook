import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import intersectionByJs from '../setup/src/intersection-by.js';
import intersectionByTs from '../setup/src/intersection-by.ts';

## Solution

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: intersectionByJs, tsx: intersectionByTs }} />

The solution first creates Sets of transformed values from arrays 2 onwards using the iteratee for efficient lookups. It then filters the first array by checking if each element's transformed value is present in all these Sets via `has()`. Finally, it collects the corresponding original values from the first array that satisfy the condition.
