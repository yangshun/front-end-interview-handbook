**Note:** It is recommended to have completed the [Cancellable Interval](/questions/javascript/cancellable-interval) question before attempting this question.

## Solution

The complexity of this question lies in modelling the inner state of the interval, whether it's paused, running, or stopped (which is a terminal state) and how to modify the state correctly based on the methods.

### Approach 1: Using a `stopped` boolean flag

We can have use variables, `timerId` and `stopped` to model all possible states:

- If `timerId` is `null`, the interval is paused.
- If `timerId` is non-`null`, the interval is running and the value is the ID of the timer.
- If `stopped` is `true`, the interval has stopped and cannot be restarted, regardless of the `timerId` value.

In our `start` and `pause` functions, we first have to check if `stopped` is `true` and terminate if so.

In the `start` function, we have to first check if `timerId != null`, and terminate early as well, otherwise we will be running two intervals at the same time.

In the `pause` function, once we have determined the interval is not in the `stopped` state, call `clearInterval(timerId)` to stop the interval callback.

In the `stop` function, set `stopped` to `true` and call `clearInterval(timerId)` to stop the interval callback. It doesn't matter if the interval is still running because `clearInterval(null)` is a no-op.

We don't have to worry about `this` within the callback function because there's no option to pass a `thisArg` to `setInterval` unlike `Array.prototype.forEach()`/`Array.prototype.reduce()`.

## Approach 2: State machine

With 3 states and 3 possible actions, modeling the state and actions with imperative logic is already starting to feel complicated. State machines are a declarative way to model state and the associated interactions. A state machine takes the current state and an action and returns the next state. We can then call the necessary logic based on the new state.

For this question, we have the following states and actions:

- States: `'paused'`, `'stopped'`, `'running'`
- Actions: `start()`, `pause()`, `stop()`

We can define a `stateMachine` object where the top-level key is the current state, and the values are objects where the key is an action and value is the new state. Deriving the new state is simply `const newState = stateMachine[state][action]`.

If the `newState` and the current `state` is the same, there's nothing to be done. Otherwise, we can perform the necessary logic based on the `newState`, either to stop the interval or start it. The exposed methods just have to call the `nextState` function with the corresponding action.

Although there's some duplication in the values of the key, it is much easier to determine at a glance that the state transitions are correct. Compare to the other approach, this state machine approach requires much fewer conditional statements and state assignment statements!
