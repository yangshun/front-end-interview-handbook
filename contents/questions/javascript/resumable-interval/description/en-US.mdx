title: Resumable Interval
excerpt: Implement a function that creates a resumable interval object
---

**Note:** It is recommended to have completed the [Cancellable Interval](/questions/javascript/cancellable-interval) question before attempting this question.

Implement a function `createResumableInterval`, that acts like `setInterval` and has the exact same signature. However instead of returning a timer ID, it returns an object that contains three methods:

1. `start`: Runs the callback **immediately** and every `delay` milliseconds.
1. `pause`: Pauses the interval so that it stops running. Execution can be resumed by calling `start()` again.
1. `stop`: Stops the interval permanently, cannot be restarted.

```js
createResumableInterval(callback);
createResumableInterval(callback, delay);
createResumableInterval(callback, delay, param1);
createResumableInterval(callback, delay, param1, param2);
createResumableInterval(callback, delay, param1, param2, /* â€¦ ,*/ paramN);
```

You are recommended to read up on for `setInterval` on [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval) if you are unfamiliar.

## Examples

```js
let i = 0;
// t = 0:
const interval = createResumableInterval(() => {
  i++;
}, 10);
// t = 10:
interval.start(); // i is now 1.
// t = 20: callback executes and i is now 2.
// t = 25:
interval.pause();
// t = 30: i remains at 2 because interval.pause() was called.
// t = 35:
interval.start(); // i is now 3.
// t = 45: callback executes and i is now 4.
// t = 50:
interval.stop(); // i remains at 4.
```
