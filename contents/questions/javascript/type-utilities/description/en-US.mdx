title: Type Utilities
excerpt: Implement utilities to determine primitive variable types in JavaScript
---

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means the types of variable can be changed during runtime. Many interview questions involve recursion of values that contain values of different types and how to handle each value type (e.g. different code is needed to iterate over an array vs an object). Knowledge of handling the JavaScript types is crucial to solving questions like [Deep Clone](/questions/javascript/deep-clone) and [Deep Equal](/questions/javascript/deep-equal).

In this question, we will implement the following utility functions to determine the types of primitive values.

- `isBoolean(value)`: Return `true` if `value` is a boolean, `false` otherwise.
- `isNumber(value)`: Return `true` if `value` is a number, `false` otherwise. Note that `NaN` is considered a number.
- `isNull(value)`: Return `true` if `value` is `null`, `false` otherwise.
- `isString(value)`: Return `true` if `value` is a `String`, else `false`.
- `isSymbol(value)`: Return `true` if `value` is a `Symbol` primitive, else `false`.
- `isUndefined(value)`: Return `true` if `value` is `undefined`, else `false`.
