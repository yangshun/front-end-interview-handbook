title: Intersection With
excerpt: Computes the intersection of arrays using a custom comparator function to determine equality between elements
---

The `intersectionWith` function takes a custom `comparator` function and multiple arrays as arguments. It compares the elements of the arrays using the `comparator` function to determine equality. The function returns a new array containing the elements that are present in all given arrays.

```ts
intersectionWith(comparator, ...arrays);
```

## Arguments

1. `comparator` _(Function)_: The comparator function used to determine equality between elements. The function will be invoked with two arguments `(arrVal, othVal)` representing the two elements being compared. It should return `true` if the elements are considered equal, and `false` otherwise.
1. `arrays` _(...Array)_: The arrays to inspect.

## Returns

_(Array)_: Returns the array after intersection of arrays.

## Examples

```js
const arr1 = [
  { x: 1, y: 2 },
  { x: 2, y: 3 },
];
const arr2 = [
  { y: 2, x: 1 },
  { x: 3, y: 4 },
];

const result = intersectionWith(
  (a, b) => a.x === b.x && a.y === b.y,
  arr1,
  arr2,
); // => [{ x: 1, y: 2 }]
```

## Notes

- In Lodash, `comparator` is optional and is the last parameter, but in this question it is a required parameter for simplicity.
- The order of elements in the resulting array is determined by the order in which they appear in the first array.
- If no arrays are provided, the function will return an empty array.
- If any of the arrays are empty, the function will return an empty array.
