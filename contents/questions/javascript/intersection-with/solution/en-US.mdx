import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import intersectionWithJs from '../setup/src/intersection-with.js';
import intersectionWithTs from '../setup/src/intersection-with.ts';

## Solution

<MDXCodeBlock
  languages={{ jsx: intersectionWithJs, tsx: intersectionWithTs }}
/>

The solution iterates over the values of the first array using `.filter`. For each value, it checks whether in every other array there is some value such that the comparator function returns true. If so, then the value passes the filter and is included in the returned array.
