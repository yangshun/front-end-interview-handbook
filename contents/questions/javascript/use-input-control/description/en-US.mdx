title: useInputControl
excerpt: Implement a hook that manages a controlled input value and tracks its dirty & touched state
---

Implement a `useInputControl` hook that manages a controlled input value and tracks additional form input states like:

| Property | Tracks | When it becomes `true` | When it becomes `false` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Touched | If input has been focused then blurred | When the user blurs the input (focus -> blur) | Never resets automatically |
| Dirty | If value has been changed before | When the user types something Never resets automatically |
| Different | If value is different from the original | When the value is different from the initial | When the value is same as the initial |

The `handleX` functions returned by the hook are meant to be called on the relevant event handlers of `<input>` in order for the hook to work as intended.

```jsx
export default function Component() {
  const nameInput = useInputControl('Oliver');

  return (
    <form>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="name">Name</label>
        <input
          id="name"
          value={nameInput.value}
          onChange={nameInput.handleChange}
          onBlur={nameInput.handleBlur}
        />
      </div>
      <p>Touched: {nameInput.touched.toString()}</p>
      <p>Dirty: {nameInput.dirty.toString()}</p>
      <p>Different: {nameInput.different.toString()}</p>
      <button type="submit" disabled={!nameInput.different}>
        Submit
      </button>
      <button type="button" onClick={nameInput.reset}>
        Reset
      </button>
    <form>
  );
}
```

## Arguments

- `initialValue: string`: The initial value of the input

## Returns

The hook returns an object with the following properties:

- `value: string`: The current value of the input
- `dirty: boolean`: Whether the user has been modified at least once
- `touched: boolean`: Whether the input was focused and blurred
- `different: boolean`: Whether the value is different from the initial value
- `handleChange: (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void`: A function that updates the value of the input
- `handleBlur: (event: React.FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void`: A function that to be called when the input is blurred
- `reset: () => void`: A function to reset to the initial value as well as the value of all states
