import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import sizeJs from '../setup/src/size.js';
import sizeTs from '../setup/src/size.ts';

## Solution

This question evaluates one's knowledge on the different JavaScript types and how to check for the size of the contents.

It's crucial to know how to differentiate between the different object types. `typeof collection` gives you `'object'` for `Array`s, `Map`s, `Set`s, `Object`s, and even `null`! Hence it's necessary to check for the more specific types earlier in the code and use the appropriate API to obtain the collection length.
