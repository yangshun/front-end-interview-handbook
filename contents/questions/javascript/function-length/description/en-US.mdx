title: Function Length
excerpt: Implement a function that returns the number of parameters expected by a function
---

Implement a function `functionLength`, to return the number of parameters a function expects. Note that this is a static value defined by the function, not the number of arguments the function is called with (which is determined by `arguments.length`)

P.S. Practically, there's no need for this function since it is a simple wrapper. However, it is useful to know how to determine the number of parameters a function expects, which is useful for questions like [Curry II](/questions/javascript/curry-ii).

```js
function foo() {}
function bar(a) {}
function baz(a, b) {}

functionLength(foo); // 0
functionLength(bar); // 1
functionLength(baz); // 2
```
