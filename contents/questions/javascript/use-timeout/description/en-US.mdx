excerpt: Implement a hook that invokes a callback function after a specified delay
---

Implement a `useTimeout` hook that invokes a callback function after a specified delay.

Note that the hooks can be called again with different values since the initial call:

- **Different callback**: The pending timer should invoke the latest callback. If the timer has already expired, the callback is not executed and no new timer will be set
- **Different delay**: The previous timeout should be cancelled if the timer hasn't expired, a new timer is set with the new delay value

The primary benefit of `useTimeout` is so that you don't have to manually clear call `clearTimeout()` if the component unmounts before the timer expires.

```jsx
export default function Component() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useTimeout(() => setLoading(false), 1000);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{loading ? 'Loading' : 'Ready'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Arguments

1. `callback: () => void`: A function to be called after the specified delay
2. `delay: number | null`: The delay in milliseconds before the invocation of the callback function. If `null`, the timeout is cleared

## Returns

Nothing.
