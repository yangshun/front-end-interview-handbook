excerpt: Implement a function to safely access deeply-nested properties in JavaScript objects
---

Before the optional chaining operator (`?.`) existed, it was sometimes troublesome to access deeply-nested properties in huge JavaScript objects when some of the intermediate properties might not be present.

```js
const john = {
  profile: {
    name: { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' },
    age: 20,
    gender: 'Male',
  },
};

const jane = {
  profile: {
    age: 19,
    gender: 'Female',
  },
};

function getFirstName(user) {
  return user.profile.name.firstName;
}
```

Doing `getFirstName(john)` works but `getFirstName(jane)` will error because the `name` property doesn't exist for `jane.profile`.

## Lodash's `_.get` method

Lodash's `_.get` method was created as a solution for such use cases.

Let's write our own version as a `get` function. The function gets the value at `path` of `object`. If the resolved value is `undefined`, the `defaultValue` is returned in its place. The function signature is as such:

```js
get(object, path, [defaultValue]);
```

- `object`: The object to query.
- `path`: The path of the property to get. It can be a string with `.` as the separator between fields, or an array of path strings.
- `defaultValue`: Optional parameter. The value returned if the resolved value is `undefined`.

## Examples

```js
get(john, 'profile.name.firstName'); // 'John'
get(john, 'profile.gender'); // 'Male'
get(jane, 'profile.name.firstName'); // undefined
```

Arrays can also be accessed if numerical indices are provided.

```js
get({ a: [{ b: { c: 3 } }] }, 'a.0.b.c'); // 3
```

There's no need to support syntax resembling `get(object, 'a[0].b.c')`.
