import sumByJs from '../setup/src/sum-by.js';
import sumByTs from '../setup/src/sum-by.ts';

## Solution

Here's a solution that finds the sum of elements in `array` based on a given `iteratee`. It iterates through the `array`, calls the `iteratee` function with the array element, and tracks the sum of the values.

Two variables are used:

- `sum`: Tracks the sum to return.
- `found`: Tracks whether a valid number is found to be added to `sum`, else it will cause the function to return `NaN`.

## Edge cases

Because `iteratee` is user-provided and can return a value of any type, we have to pay special attention to ignore computed values that cannot be compared, like `null` and `undefined`. For such computed values, they should be ignored entirely.
