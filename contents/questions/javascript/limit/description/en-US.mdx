title: Limit
excerpt: Implement a function that accepts a callback and restricts its invocation to at most N times
---

Implement a function that accepts a callback and a number `n`, which restricts invocation of the callback to at most `n` times. Subsequent calls of the created function will return the result of the last invocation of the callback function. The callback function is invoked with the `this` binding and arguments of the created function.

## Examples

```js
let i = 1;

function incrementBy(value) {
  i += value;
  return i;
}

const incrementByAtMostThrice = limit(incrementBy, 3);
incrementByAtMostThrice(2); // i is now 3; The function returns 3.
incrementByAtMostThrice(3); // i is now 6; The function returns 6.
incrementByAtMostThrice(4); // i is now 10; The function returns 10.
incrementByAtMostThrice(5); // i is still 10 as this is the 4th invocation; The function returns 10 as it's the result of the last invocation.
i = 4;
incrementByAtMostThrice(2); // i is still 4 as it is not modified. The function still returns 10.
```
