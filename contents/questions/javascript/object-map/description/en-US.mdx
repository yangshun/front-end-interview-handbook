title: Object Map
excerpt: Implement a function to transform values within an object
---

Implement a function `objectMap(obj, fn)` to return a new object containing the results of calling a provided function on every value in the object. The function `fn` is called with a single argument, the `value` that is being mapped/transformed.

## Examples

```js
const double = (x) => x * 2;
objectMap({ foo: 1, bar: 2 }, double); // => { foo: 2, bar: 4}
```
