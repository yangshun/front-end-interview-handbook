This question might seem easy on first glance, but the nuances make the question trickier than it seems on the surface. Knowing the nuances differentiates senior candidates and gives you bonus points. Are you aware that:

- The reducer callback is passed the `currentIndex` and `array` as the third and fourth argument respectively?
- If there is no initial value supplied to the reduce function, the array element at index 0 is used and the iteration starts from the next element (index 1 instead of index 0).

## Solution

The rest of the implementation is straightforward with these nuances taken into account. As we loop through the array (via `this`), call the callback on each array element with the following parameters: `acc`, `element`, `index`, and `this`. The returned value will become the new `acc` to be passed to the next call of the `callbackFn`.

## Edge cases

- Empty array, with and without the `initialValue` argument.
- Single-value array, with and without the `initialValue` argument.
- Passing the `index` and `array` to the reducer callback.
- Sparse arrays, e.g. `[1, 2, , 4]`. The empty values should be ignored while traversing the array.

## Notes

Mutating the array in the reduce callback is a bad idea and can cause unintended consequences. It is a positive signal to mention that mutation of the array within the callback is possible. The provided solution follows the TC39 specification for array mutation scenarios:

- The range of elements processed by `reduce` is set before the first callback is called.
- Elements appended to the array after the call to `reduce` begins will not be visited by the callback.
- If existing elements of the array are changed, their value as passed to the callback will be the value at the time `reduce` visits them.
- Elements that are deleted after the call to `reduce` begins and before being visited are not visited.

## One-liner solution

You can cheat the autograder by doing this:

```js
Array.prototype.myReduce = Array.prototype.reduce;
```

## Spec solution

Here's a solution that is based off the [`Array.prototype.reduce` ECMAScript specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/indexed-collections.html#sec-array.prototype.reduce).
