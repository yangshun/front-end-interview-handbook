## Solution

### Approach 1: Using `push()`

1. The `chunk` function takes two parameters: `array` (the input array to be chunked) and `size` (the desired size of each chunk).
1. It performs the same initial checks to ensure `array` is a valid array and `size` is positive. If not, it returns an empty array `[]`.
1. Two variables are initialized: `result` to store the chunks and `chunk` to build each individual chunk.
1. A `for` loop iterates through the `array`. In each iteration, the current element is added to the `chunk` array.
1. After adding an element to the `chunk`, it checks if the `chunk` has reached the desired `size` or if it has reached the end of the `array`. If either condition is true, it means a chunk is complete, and it's added to the `result` array.
1. If the chunk is complete, a new, empty `chunk` array is created to start building the next chunk.
1. The loop continues until all elements of the `array` have been processed.
1. Finally, the function returns the `result` array containing the chunks.

### Approach 2: Using `slice()`

A more elegant solution that is shorter and requires fewer variables is to extract out the exact slice of the elements from the array.
