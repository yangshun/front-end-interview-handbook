title: Cancellable Interval
excerpt: Implement a function that acts like setInterval but returns a function to cancel the interval
---

Implement a function `setCancellableInterval`, that acts like `setInterval` but instead of returning a timer ID, it returns a function that when called, cancels the interval. The `setCancellableInterval` function should have the exact same signature as `setInterval`:

```js
setCancellableInterval(callback);
setCancellableInterval(callback, delay);
setCancellableInterval(callback, delay, param1);
setCancellableInterval(callback, delay, param1, param2);
setCancellableInterval(callback, delay, param1, param2, /* â€¦ ,*/ paramN);
```

You are recommended to read up on for `setInterval` on [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval) if you are unfamiliar.

## Examples

```js
let i = 0;
// t = 0:
const cancel = setCancellableInterval(() => {
  i++;
}, 10);
// t = 10: i is 1
// t = 20: i is 2
cancel(); // Called at t = 25
// t = 30: i is still 2 because cancel() was called and the interval callback has stopped running.
```
