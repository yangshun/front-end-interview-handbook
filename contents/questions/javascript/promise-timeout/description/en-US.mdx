title: Promise Timeout
excerpt: Implement a function that resolves a promise if it is fulfilled within a timeout period and rejects otherwise
---

When fetching data or performing other async operations, it is sometimes useful to set a timeout duration, i.e. enforce that a response is received before the timeout, otherwise deem the request a failed one.

Implement a `promiseTimeout` function that accepts a promise and a timeout duration (in milliseconds) and returns a `Promise`. If the promise argument is settled within the timeout period, the returned promise is settled with the promise argument's settled value, which can be both resolved/rejected values. Otherwise, the returned promise will reject with the string "Promise timeout".

```js
function fakeFetch(latency) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulate an asynchronous operation that resolves after `latency`.
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('Data successfully fetched!');
    }, latency);
  });
}

const response = await promiseTimeout(fakeFetch(1000), 2000);
console.log(response); // Data successfully fetched!

await promiseTimeout(fakeFetch(5000), 2000);
// "Promise timeout" thrown.
```
