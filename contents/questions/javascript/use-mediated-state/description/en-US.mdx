Implement a `useMediatedState` hook that is similar to `useState`, but supports a mediator function that runs on each state set. This mediator function can be used to transform or intercept state updates.

```jsx
const replaceMultipleSpaces = (s) => s.replace(/[\s]+/g, ' ');

export default function Component() {
  const [state, setState] = useMediatedState(replaceMultipleSpaces, '');

  return (
    <div>
      <div>You will not be able to enter more than one space</div>
      <input
        type="text"
        min="0"
        max="10"
        value={state}
        onChange={(e) => setState(e.target.value)}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Arguments

1. `mediator`: A function that receives the new state and returns the transformed state. This function can have two forms:

   1. `(newState: T) => T` that receives 1 argument: the new state dispatched by `setState`, and returns the final state, or
   2. `(newState: T, dispatch) => void` that receives 2 arguments: the new state dispatched by `setState`, and a function `dispatch` that will actually run the state update. It returns nothing.

2. `initialState`: The initial state value

**Note**: `mediator` should stay the same, even if it's changed into a new and/or different function.

## Returns

The hook returns an array with two elements:

1. The current state
2. The function `setState` to update the state. It must be the same as the second element of the array returned by `useState`

Essentially, the hook returns the same values as `useState`.
