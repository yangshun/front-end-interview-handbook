Implement a `useKeyPress` hook that detects and performs an action for keyboard events

```jsx
export default function Component() {
  useKeyPress('a', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('The "a" key was pressed');
  });

  return null;
}
```

**Note**: Even though the hook is called `useKeyPress`, the `keypress` browser event is [deprecated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/keypress_event) and should not be used.

## Arguments

1. `key: string`: The key to detect. It must be a [valid key value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values) that is usually obtained from `KeyboardEvent.key`
2. `callback: (event: KeyboardEvent) => void`: A function that is called when the key identified by `key` is pressed
3. `options`: An optional object with the following properties:
   - `target: EventTarget`: The target element to listen for the key press. This defaults to `window`
   - `event: 'keydown' | 'keyup'`: The event to listen for, defaults to `'keydown'`

## Returns

Nothing.
