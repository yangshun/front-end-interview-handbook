Design a **desktop** email client that can send and receive email messages given an email provider service.

![Email Client Example](/img/questions/email-client-outlook/email-client-example.png)

It's important to distinguish between **webmail** and email client apps. Websites like gmail.com, outlook.com, Yahoo Mail which allow you to use the browser to access email is called webmail. Email clients are desktop apps that have to be installed on your computer and can usually be used even when offline. They usually allow access to multiple email services like Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, etc and view messages from different services within the app.
