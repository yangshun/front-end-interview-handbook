Autocomplete is a common question asked by many companies and encompasses many useful front end concepts and techniques which can be generalized to other front end system design questions. It is highly recommended to study this question well and thoroughly!

## Question

Design an autocomplete UI component that allows users to enter a search term into a text box, a list of search results appear in a popup and the user can select a result.

Some real-life examples where you might have seen this component in action:

- Google's search bar on google.com where you see a list of primarily text-based suggestions.
- Facebook's search input where you see a list of rich results. The results can be friends, celebrities, groups, pages, etc.

A back end API is provided which will return a list of results based on the search query.

### Requirements

- The component is generic enough to be usable by different websites.
- The input field UI and search results UI should be customizable.
