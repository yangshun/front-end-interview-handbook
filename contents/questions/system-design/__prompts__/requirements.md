I'm authoring system design questions for front end engineers. The system design questions are mainly for client applications and focus on product, user interface, user experience and less about the back end and distributed systems.

Requirements exploration involves understanding the problem thoroughly and determine the scope by asking a number of clarifying questions.

Given the following applications and example questions within code blocks, generate a suitable set of clarifying questions candidates should be asking for <QUESTION>. The title of the question is before the "===".

Primarily text and image-based posts. If time permits we can discuss more types of posts.
