Front End Engineers are also Software Engineers after all, and it's an expectation that Front End Engineers have basic competency in algorithms and data structures. It is possible and reasonable that you will be asked to solve algorithmic questions during your front end interviews and most likely you will be expected to use JavaScript.

Trees are a commonly-encountered data structure in Front End development because the DOM is a tree, so if you have to prioritize, definitely focus on being good at tree data structures and common algorithms for trees, such as Breadth-first Search and Depth-first Search.

The [Tech Interview Handbook](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/introduction/) goes into great detail about preparing for Algorithms questions.

### [Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview?aff=x23W)

This course by Educative expands upon the questions on the recommended practice questions but approaches the practicing from a questions pattern perspective, which is an approach I also agree with for learning and have personally used to get better at coding interviews. The course allows you to practice selected questions in Java, Python, C++, JavaScript and also provides sample solutions in those languages. **Learn and understand patterns, not memorize answers!** [**Check it out →**](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview?aff=x23W)

### [Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms](https://fxo.co/DQpY)

This Udemy bestseller is one of the highest-rated interview preparation course (4.6 stars, 21.5k ratings, 135k students) and packs **19 hours** worth of contents into it. Like Tech Interview Handbook, it goes beyond coding interviews and covers resume, non-technical interviews, negotiations. It's an all-in-one package! Note that JavaScript is being used for the coding demos. [**Check it out →**](https://fxo.co/DQpY)
