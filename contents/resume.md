### 2. Test readability with industry-standard ATS

Test the readability and formatting of your resume using [OpenResume, a free resume parser](https://www.open-resume.com/resume-parser) or [NodeFlair's free resume ATS checker](https://nodeflair.com/resume-checker). Most big companies use similar resume scanners.

### 3. The plain text file test

Simply copy the content from your resume and paste it into a plain text document! Make edits if:

- There are points missing from your original resume
- Characters are displaying incorrectly in plain text
- Sections are disorganized
