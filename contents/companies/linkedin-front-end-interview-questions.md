## Insider tips from the GreatFrontEnd community

These tips were shared by [GreatFrontEnd](https://www.greatfrontend.com/?utm_source=frontendinterviewhandbook&utm_medium=referral&gnrs=frontendinterviewhandbook) users who have completed interviews with LinkedIn.

**13th May 2025**:

> Linkedin technical screen experience for Senior FE role - 1 hr interview, lots of parts to this one:
> 
> FE quiz questions - event delegation, closures, etc
> Memoize I+II
> Implement infinite scroll with data fetching/pagination - implementation is in plain JS, can optimize with throttle
> 
> General thoughts - They're primarily testing for JS fundamentals, you gotta know your stuff real well to pass. I'm guessing they conduct interviews this way bc their FE codebase is written in Ember which not many ppl have experience with 

> (How did you implement infinite scrolling? Did you use IntersectionObserver?)
> 
> I just used scroll events since they provided some boilerplate code for it, but IntersectionObserver would've been better to use had I been more familiar with the api. But I think the idea is generally the same where you check for a boundary being crossed, fetch more data and then take each item and append it to the parent container.
> 
> Honestly I fumbled on this one tho, I haven't spent as much time on vanilla JS implementations vs react so I was a lot less confident in general. Also I'm surprised they even wanted to interview me for a senior role consider I'm only at ~3 yoe lol.

**28th Jan 2025**:

> LinkedIn US asked JS/web/html trivia questions and a Leetcode easy question for the phone screen round. Not sure about the onsite

**5th Jan 2025**:

> LinkedIn US asked JS/web/html trivia questions and a Leetcode easy question for the phone screen round. Not sure about the onsite
> 
> Their systems design question was also not one I had seen before, and was difficult to understand. However in retro, asking more questions about "how it should work if the user does x, y, z" would have got me to design a better answer.
> 
> I went back to try and solve it correctly. I was not really satisfied with any solution until reading white paper on the subject asked. 

**5th Jan 2025**:

> Is it frontend or fullstack? They ask leetcode for fullstack. Merge intervals is one question
> Study for tic tac toe and autocomplete questions
