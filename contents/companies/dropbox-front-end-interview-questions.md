Dropbox focuses on practical questions for their Front End Engineering interview loop rather than on raw algorithmic coding.

> Our web developer interviews focus on practical application of HTML/CSS/JS for building web UI. The questions are based on real-world examples rather than raw coding exercises. You will be given a design spec and asked to build the best solution you can that demonstrates your experience and grasp of web development technologies.

Refer to the [full official Dropbox Web Developer Interview Preparation Guide](/guides/dropbox-web-developer-guide.pdf).
