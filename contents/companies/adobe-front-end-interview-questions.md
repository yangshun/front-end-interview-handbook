## Insider tips from the GreatFrontEnd community

These tips were shared by [GreatFrontEnd](https://www.greatfrontend.com/?utm_source=frontendinterviewhandbook&utm_medium=referral&gnrs=frontendinterviewhandbook) users who have completed interviews with Adobe.

**19th Jun 2025**:

> Attended Adobe system design, it was non frontend system design. I was asked to design LRU cache and design the classes and interfaces for a chess game.
> Also had the hiring manager round, was asked to implement the flood fill algorithm. i.e. there is a m*n grid which has outlines of some shapes. If clicked inside any shape, then the shape should be flood filled. If clicked outside the shape, then the whole grid should be flood filled except the shapes.
> 
> Had to implement the pseudo code only though. 

**16th Jun 2025**:

> Attended Adobe interview. In the language and web fundamentals round, a question similar to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/leaders-in-an-array-1587115620/1 was asked. 
> 
> Another question that was asked was the following: You are given an API getAllLinks(url) which returns all the links on the page. You have to write a function to return all the descendant links (i.e. child urls of child urls and so on) of  the url. Edge cases were built on top of this: what if there are circular dependencies between pages? What if getAllLinks returns a promise? How can the async code be more efficient? Time complexity?
> 
> One thing to note was that I had to handrun the code as the test cases were not setup and the interviewer actually typed out the test cases instead of copy pasting.

**26th Oct 2023**:

> I had my Adobe onsite last week for FE mid-level role. It was following a HackerRank + quick QnA with HM
> 
> It was five rounds each consisting of 30min tech and 10min behavior 5min QnA
> These were some technical questions asked
> 
> LC medium - find total number of islands in a nested arr of 0 and 1 
> LC easy - covert Oct 1 23 to 10-01-23
> UI - build an accordion using JS or react
> create polyfill of .reduce
> 
> It was on the easier side but only for one headcount so I didn't get an offer
