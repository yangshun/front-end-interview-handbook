## Insider tips from the GreatFrontEnd community

These tips were shared by [GreatFrontEnd](https://www.greatfrontend.com/?utm_source=frontendinterviewhandbook&utm_medium=referral&gnrs=frontendinterviewhandbook) users who have completed interviews with Palantir.

**21st Aug 2024**:

> I had a tree / graph traversal type problem for Palantir phone screen. More leetcode-y and less FE-specific. Uber was building a small app in the UI. React GreatFrontEnd problems were super helpful with clearing that round 

**1st Jun 2024**:

> Search the server for Palantir. You’ll get a lot of tips here! Otherwise, I think this all depends on how prepared you already feel for leetcode and GreatFrontEnd questions. One week isn’t a lot of time, so I’d focus on your weakest topics and topics most likely to be asked 
> I mentioned leetcode because other people here who interviewed with Palantir said they had leetcode questions. Using the interview as just a practice is good too, if you really don’t wanna study leetcode, even just the questions posted on here. 

**29th Mar 2024**:

> Hi for Palantir, it was a leetcode style question. I had to validate a graph and there were some additional questions about time and space complexity afterwards.
> Hope this is not too late. The interviewer determined if it passed or not. There were no automatic tests. 

**26th Mar 2024**:

> Just finished up a tech screen with Palantir. Pretty leetcode-y. Was asked to take a text and a query of two words, an integer k, and return the indicies of where the distance between the two words is <= k. Got a semi-optimal solution, but wasn't the most optimal (we went through the most optimal after). Was essentially just a text document  (i.e. no test cases, I wrote the function signature, no ability to run the code). We'll see what happens 🤷‍♂️

**25th Mar 2025**:

> I have one tomorrow with them for a full-stack role leaning frontend. Here's what the recruiter told me to expect for the interview process: - Technical Interview — Leetcode, DSA
> - 2 Interviews
>     - Web Dev
>     - Decomposition Interview (System Design)
> - Hiring Manager Interview
