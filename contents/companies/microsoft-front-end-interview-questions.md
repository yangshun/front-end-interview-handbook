## Insider tips from the GreatFrontEnd community

These tips were shared by [GreatFrontEnd](https://www.greatfrontend.com/?utm_source=frontendinterviewhandbook&utm_medium=referral&gnrs=frontendinterviewhandbook) users who have completed interviews with Microsoft.

**20th May 2025**:

> Honestly my interviews at Microsoft were much more chill than Amazon tbh. I do not mind the LPâ€™s but the amount of dry runs they made me do was shocking. I even wrote assert statements before hand but turns out no execution allowed for Amazon. 
> 
> MSFT however, everything was smooth.

**8th May 2025**:

> I passed the Senior fe loop for a similar team to Microsoft (Copilot) last year. A team which was working on embedding copilot inside m365
> Just a standard interview, system design was just catered to modularizing copilot so it can plug into any app

**25th Apr 2025**:

> I did a senior one in 2024 which is roughly the same loop as Microsoft's SDE II but more emphasis on system design

**31st Jan 2025**:

> Hi! Just wanted to give a huge shoutout to GreatFrontEnd and say thanks for all the amazing work the team is doing! After leaving AWS a couple of months back, I was pretty nervous about the job market and didnâ€™t know what to expect. But with GreatFrontEnd as my best friend (and, honestly, confidant lol) throughout the interview process, I was able to land interviews and offers at multiple companies for senior frontend/full stack roles.
> 
> Thanks to you, I either got an offer or made it to the onsite stage at the following companies. In each one, I found some element of my prep from GreatFrontEnd extremely valuable:
> 
> Vanta
> Remitly
> Coinbase
> Microsoft
> Lululemon
> TikTok
> Google
> 
> One thing I did find a bit frustrating in system design rounds, though, was how most companies (Even Microsoft) focused on API design but skipped over more advanced frontend deep dives. I love the depth and deep-dives  in the prep materialâ€”they really made me a better engineerâ€”even if I didnâ€™t always get to showcase it in interviews.
> 
> So grateful for all the support and resources! ðŸ™Œ
> Following up on my earlier thread, I was responding to someone about my experience with Microsoft and thought Iâ€™d share it here for the community as well.
> 
> I had two separate Microsoft onsitesâ€”both for Microsoft Teams and Senior Frontend positionsâ€”but they were very different.
> 
> First onsite (I received an offer for this):
> React-based interview â€“ Very easy. It included a 30-minute behavioral round followed by a technical session. The question was more like an implementation of a basic to-do app (Add/Remove/Edit todos).
> Algorithm round â€“ LeetCode Easy/Medium. Another 30-minute behavioral session followed by coding.
> Hiring manager round â€“ Behavioral + System Design. This was more full-stack focused, but the interviewer gave me the option to deep dive into either frontend or backend, depending on my preference. However, the initial design needed to be full-stack. The task was to implement a part of Microsoft Teams itself. I really loved the discussionâ€”it was very open-ended and adaptive.
> JavaScript coding â€“ I was asked to design an SDK in JavaScript, implementing features like throttling, retry strategies, etc. The focus was on defining contracts that others would need to adhere to. It felt more like a mix of system design and coding.
> 
> Second onsite (No offer for this):
> LeetCode Medium â€“ A variation of the 3Sum problem.
> LeetCode Hard - Still have PTSD from this ðŸ˜„
> LeetCode Medium â€“ More of an implementation-focused merge sort problem.
> System design + Hiring manager â€“ Focused more on API design; the interviewer didnâ€™t care about frontend deep dives at all.
> 
> Itâ€™s very difficult to predict Microsoft interviewsâ€”they have no set format whatsoever. Really didnâ€™t enjoy the second loop, but they didnâ€™t seem to like me eitherâ€”so I guess itâ€™s even! ðŸ˜…

**23rd Nov 2024**:

> Alright guys/gals I just had a frontend interview for a contract role at Microsoft. Overall it was challenging, but not overbearingly difficult. 
> 
> The interview consisted of two 45 minute rounds. Interview One was a coding round in React with a senior dev. Second Interview was just a technical discussion with a principal engineer. More details about interview one:
> 
> Implement the number/character pad using buttons (kind of like the old school flip phones) where 2 == abc, 3 == def, etc, and display the string that is being pressed. Example:
> press 2 --> "a"
> press 2 again --> "b"
> press 2 after a 1 second delay --> "ba"
> press 6 --> "bam"
> 
> As I said it was challenging. Honestly I don't think I'll get the contract position. I get nervous easily and trying to control my jitters was an issue in the beginning. Because of this I made a lot of silly mistakes that really slowed me down. Also, admittedly some of react skills are rusty in some parts. I'm not giving though. I think the silver lining of all this was once I got into my rhythm I was able to convey my thoughts more clearly and able to break down the problem further. Also I learned I'm not completely incompetent in react which helps ðŸ˜„
> 
> But yeah just wanted to share my experience. Hope it helps and if anyone can help me with the solution that be great!
