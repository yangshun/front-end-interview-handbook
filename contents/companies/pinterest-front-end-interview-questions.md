**3rd Apr 2024**:

> I trÃ­ed few months ago. I did the first round only for a release engineer position. The problem is called Can you win. And it is similar to that in Leetcode jump and jump II.
> They are medium level problems. At least you can solve 2 in 20-30 mins. They recommend that.

**4th Feb 2024**:

> Last time I interviewed for a FE engineer role at Pinterest in 2019, it was 3 LC rounds. one required a trie data structure to solve a string DSA. "Given a stream of comments, detect inappropriate language". I would be interested to know if they do have a true FE track. 
> Just re-read this question. I thought you were asking about onsite. The question I got for phone screen was:
> 
> Given an array of integers like [1,2,0,4,3] and a starting index, return true if you are able to get to a "0" value. Return false if you can't. Each value in the array is how many steps to the left or right you can move. You have to take that many steps exactly. If you are at the start or end of the array and you have movements left, you can wrap around to the opposite side.
> 
> ex: same array, but startingIdx = 3. It returns true because you can go 1 step to the right, then 3 steps to the right starting at 0. 
> 
> So this is backtracking plus keeping track of which indexes you've finished evaluating. I've never seen this on LC. I think I spent 15 mins trying to voice out the solution. 15 minutes coding. Finished. 15 minutes of talking back and forth about Pinterest. Ended the interview 15 minutes early. 
> hilariously, i got the same question on the onsite and then there was a follow up question to this which was: you've used recursion to solve htis, but can you solve this without it? So instead of a (call) stack of nodes to process, use a queue, 
> Pinterest was the worst interview experience I've gone through for frontend. Position asked for React experience, didn't write a single line of JavaScript. Only Python for DSA. So it would be a breath of fresh air if they did create an FE track since 2019 
> Yup, passed the phone screen, went to onsite. Didn't get offer because I wasn't very good with string DSA at the time

**4th Feb 2024**:

> yes, afaik they have a FE track and a full stack track for interviews. thats what the recruiter alluded to because im teetering between FE and full stack and she mentioned that the interview might be different if i wanted to focus on full stack 

**12th Sep 2023**:

> So, the recruiter just explained to me, that there will be 1 Algos, 1 Frontend Coding with React, 1 Frontend System Design and 1 Behavioral for Pinterest's onsite
