These tips were shared by [GreatFrontEnd](https://www.greatfrontend.com/?utm_source=frontendinterviewhandbook&utm_medium=referral&gnrs=frontendinterviewhandbook) users who have completed interviews with Lyft.

**6th Feb 2025**:

> Got an offer from Lyft, thanks GreatFrontEnd! The practical interviews were pretty much all questions from GreatFrontEnd, the FE systems was harder than expected, asked me to design a file management system like GitHub repo files view.

**18th Oct 2023**:

> I once had the [Digital Clock](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/user-interface/digital-clock/?utm_source=frontendinterviewhandbook&utm_medium=referral&gnrs=frontendinterviewhandbook) question for Lyft interview ðŸ˜¦ but I had an onsite to be scheduled but they didn't have my level so it seemed futile
> It was a technical phone interview, they were on the phone and I was live coding on something like a codepad
> I think it was about an hour, 10 minutes of intro and 10 minutes of questions ðŸ« 

**4th Mar 2023**:

> Lyft gives a fair bit of UI coding and JS utility fn questions. Many GreatFrontEnd questions should be helpful
