> If you do the top 100/250 of Meta leetcode questions, you have a really good chance at getting one of the questions during the interview. 

**11th May 2024**:

> Appreciate the response! I interviewed with Meta and was caught off guard with Emitter Pattern & Classnames fn when I expected DSA ðŸ˜¦

**23rd Apr 2024**:

> Hi, if you are in the front end pipeline, the questions will be focused on front end. For me, I am interviewing for IC 4/5. I have gone through a phone screen and the onsite was 4 rounds: 2 coding, 1 BQ and 1 system design. The coding is similar to the type of js questions on GreatFrontEnd and for system design, I used the RADIO framework to approach it.
> If you are interviewing for IC6 and above, I think you will need to go through one more design round but one less coding
> The next step is team matching. It could take a while, so it depends
