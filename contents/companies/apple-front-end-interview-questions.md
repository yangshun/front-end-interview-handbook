## Insider tips from the GreatFrontEnd community

These tips were shared by [GreatFrontEnd](https://www.greatfrontend.com/?utm_source=frontendinterviewhandbook&utm_medium=referral&gnrs=frontendinterviewhandbook) users who have completed interviews with Apple.

**21st May 2025**:

> in final rounds with apple, this is what recruiter explained
> 
> There will be 4 x 45 min interviews conducted virtually so can be on 1 day or split over 2. See below for focus areas. 
> 
> JavaScript: Coding (similar to tech screen) 
> Bug Hunt: Coding (working on existing code base) 
> Web Performance (Domain knowledge questions focused on Web Performance) 
> Product Thinking (Behavioral round focused on collaboration, balancing technical VS business needs and understanding user impact) 
> 
> if anyone has tips for how to practice / prepare for "bug hunt" and "product thinking" feel free to comment. i believe "web performance" will be deep JS trivia likely covering a range of concepts that are usually surfaced in FE system design interviews

**2nd Dec 2024**:

> they have a big question bank, usually team by team case
> yes they ask sys design, its a faang company so the bar is really high
> also one of the lowest paying of the faangs lol

**14th Apr 2024**:

> Think it was 6 total rounds
> All fundamentals
> Vanilla js
> 5 yoe
> 
> (In response to what do you think helped you prep for:  big tech, specifically apple is asking a lot of vanilla js questions, dom related questions?)
> GreatFrontEnd UI questions all with vanilla js implementation

**3rd Apr 2024**:

> I finished up my Apple Phone Screen. They don’t like to ask LC questions but rather asked my background and experience with 10 mins left for a super easy js question. I guess the process really depends on the team you are about to interview for. They care more about if you are a good fit for the position rather than if you are someone who can ace a LC question. Hope I can make it to the onsite. 

**12th Mar 2024**:

> I haven’t interviewed but I applied and was preparing for it a while back. Similar to other companies Apple has started prioritising system design apart from the leetcode. For leetcoding they ask trees and sorting based questions. It depends a lot on team and level of position too.
