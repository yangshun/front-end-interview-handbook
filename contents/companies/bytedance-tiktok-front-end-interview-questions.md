- Given a list of points, find out if any four of them form a square. Return 'true' if possible, else 'false'.
  - Examples: `[[0, 0], [2, 0], [1, 1], [0, -1], [-1, -1], [0, 2], [0, 1], [1,0]]` -> `true`
- Check for balanced brackets in a string.
- Given two nodes, return the section of the tree between these two nodes.

> feedback for each round was fairly quick, received update the next morning

**12th Nov 2024**:

> i do bytedance/tiktok round 2 recently, unfortunately get rejected. the coding questions is quite overwhelming for me. after experience & quiz questions, the interviewer directly give me 3 questions (all for ~30 mins), and i can choose the order.
>
> 1. similar to Map Async Limit but has to be solution 4
> 2. some compose middleware question (can't find anything similar)
> 3. implement bind, but i can't handle the new keyword

**21st Oct 2024**:

> just finish my third rounds interview with with TikTok. it's a design round with 50 mins deep dive on my pervious project and potential improvement. have to draw a flowchart to demo the workflow. overall it's really conversation heavy. and also asked why you want to join TikTok. don't think I am going to pass this round but Good Luck to whoever interview later! 🙏

**8th Aug 2024**:

> Had my first round tiktok frontend engineer interview. Not sure on the level but I told them I have 3 YOE so maybe 2-1? Strange interview tbh. There was a huge language barrier and it was difficult to build rapport with the interviewer (my interview was at night so I had someone overseas). Very difficult to read. First 20 minutes was talking about past projects/experiences/challenges, then a React coding question, then a JS quiz question, and then an untagged tiktok LC med... I asked some good questions about the company imo but the interviewer could barely answer it. I tried my best but it was not a collaborative interview at all and more of a test so it was challenging for me. I think it was a lot for an hour and we ended up going over time

**18th Jun 2024**:

> Had a second round interview with TikTok, thought I did good but didn't go through. I was asked transfer list, implemented it quick, but they interview on Lark which doesn't support React and you code in nodejs env, so no way to test anything that you write. Second question was react like VDom but instead of creating a DOM you just create a HTML string output given an input object with type and attributes. Maybe it was transfer list implementation. which I didn't compose using different components.
