## Insider tips from the GreatFrontEnd community

These tips were shared by [GreatFrontEnd](https://www.greatfrontend.com/?utm_source=frontendinterviewhandbook&utm_medium=referral&gnrs=frontendinterviewhandbook) users who have completed interviews with Atlassian.

**16th Jun 2025**:

> I havenâ€™t done Atlassian yet. These are my notes based on recruiter chat:
> The technical interview is a 60-minute video interview with two main parts:
> 
> First 10 minutes: Rapid-fire questions about modern JavaScript practices. Simple questions to test your basic understanding of JavaScript.
> 
> Remaining 45 minutes: Front-end coding portion with 1-2 coding scenarios. Key details:
> No React involved
> Focus on vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
> Solve the first question before moving to the second
> Goal is to assess your coding skills
> 
> Option to do a redo interview within 24 hours if needed, and Atlassian will take the best result (best to just do it since it will do good than harm).

**13th Jun 2025**:

> Atlassian Karat Screen (unclear if these always ask the same questions):
> -Analyze arrays (know push, pop, unshift from memory - no resources allowed)
> Know Promise.any from memory (no resources allowed)
> -Know Async Generators, await, yield, async for await loop, Promise.resolve (know from memory, no resources allowed)
> (^ for those, you just have to be able to talk about them from memory, you don't have to write code with them from memory)
> 
> Resources allowed:
> -Build a custom search widget - only HTML and CSS. You can use resources here, brushing up on css, flexbox, etc is helpful here. This wasn't written but the requirements state you can't hardcode height or width so use EM or %
> -JS/HTML - fetch todos from an API. Render 20 todos at a time. the dummy API call takes params to control how many you get. Brush up on fetch with no helper libraries, and like, creating/appending/removing dom elements. Again, pretty easy if you have time, but you don't have a lot of time, and if you (like me) haven't been writing vanilla JS and HTML like this much for years it's definitely helps speed things up to brush up on this 

**22nd May 2025**:

> Ex-atlassian here. The questions for Principal Engineer role are not known to anyone except the ones working in that position probably (at least till I was there). But what I can suggest you is to be really thorough with what DS you'd use w.r.t performance while writing the code. The interviewers are usually quite helpful in guiding you. There will be a lot of cross questioning so be prepared for it. Also, don't just go with the questions that have been asked before. The interview question bank is now much bigger and interviewers are much aware of what questions are leaked on the internet. All the best!

**27th Apr 2025**:

> As far as I know for all levels, Atlassian has a very strong emphasis on Vanilla JavaScript and Front End System Design. In your case you will probably be not given a lot of details because rarely we see Front End Engineers at Principal level. (You are one of the 5 I am hearing/seeing about)

**16th Mar 2025**:

> Based out of BLR, got an offer from Atlassian for a front-end principal role (P60).
> 
> GreatFrontEnd has helped me a lot in practicing and getting over interview anxiety. Especially the RADIO framework for system design rounds (the more senior you get, more system design rounds start to matter).
> 
> Atlassian has a well documented interview process, that can be easily found with some basic searching on the internet. Your recruiter will help you a lot in setting expectations for the upcoming round.
> 
> I had 5 rounds:
> 
> Round 1: code up a widget in React (browser coding round)
> Round 2: code up a utility in JS
> Round 3: system design round
> Round 4: leadership craft round
> Round 5: values and principles round
> 
> Atlassian relies more on follow-up / scale up questions. Instead of focusing on specific solution to a specific problem, you have to expect interviewer to keep changing the requirements and keep making the problem more and more complex.
> 
> You would be able to solve the first problem in a round easily. But if your initial solution requires a major overhaul when the follow-up question tweaks the requirement, that 's a red flag for the interview feedback.
> 
> Practicing GreatFrontEnd helped me solidify ton of concepts, and helped me feel comfortable in my skin during interviews.
> 
> Almost no company interviews candidates in an in-browser coding interview environment like GreatFrontEnd. So I used to practice setting up the problem with test cases locally in VSCode. Used Bun and Vite heavily, to avoid spending time configuring test runner, bundlers etc.
