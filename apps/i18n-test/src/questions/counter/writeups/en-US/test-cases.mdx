This is a short question which only requires one state variable, which is the number of times the button has been clicked (`count`). Attach a `'click'` event listener to the `<button>` and each time it is clicked, increment the `count` value and update the text with that value.

Since only the count needs to change, we can use a `<span>` to target the count text and update its `textContent` whenever a click event is fired.
