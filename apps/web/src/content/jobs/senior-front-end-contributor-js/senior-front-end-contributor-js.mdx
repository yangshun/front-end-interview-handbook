## What you'll do

This is a paid, **fully remote, freelancer role** open to international applicants.

### Responsibilities

Design and implement high quality front end interview **questions, code, solution writeups, and test cases** in **TypeScript**.

## Who you are

We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. Preferred qualifications are a bonus.

### Minimum requirements

- You have a strong front end technical background, with experience in tech lead or senior engineer roles.
- You have years of experience in hiring and/or interviewing front end engineers.
- You find satisfaction in building products to help others be more effective.
- You have a high degree of sensitivity towards users' needs.
- You prefer simple solutions and designs over complex ones, and have good intuition for lasting and scalable solutions.

### Preferred requirements

You have prior experience working in big tech companies popular with front end engineer job applicants.

## Pay and benefits

The rate (per question) for this role ranges from $30 – 70 USD. The actual rate will be narrowed down based on a number of factors, including the agreed scope of questions (and their complexity), the candidate's experience, qualifications, and actual location.

As this is a freelancing arrangement, there will be no employment benefits conferred.

## Take home assignment

Interested applicants should complete the following take home assignment and submit the required deliverables as part of the application.

This task will allow us to evaluate your technical skills and ability to explain concepts. We believe that it is an important part of our hiring process as it provides us with a clear understanding of your approach to writing educational engineering content.

Do not spend more than **2 hours** on this take home assignment!

### Task

Imagine yourself as someone already working as a Senior Front End Contributor at GreatFrontEnd and are writing the question description, solution code and test cases for any of the Lodash functions:

- [`_.over`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#over)
- [`_.flow`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#flow)
- [`_.isMatch`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isMatch)
- [`_.range`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#range)

_P.S. The harder the chosen task, the most impressive it is (if done well)._

### Submission deliverables

Your submission should consist of the following parts:

1. **Code**: Use either [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/), or a public GitHub repo to host your code. These platforms allow running of tests as well. You should not spend more than 2–3 hours on this entire assignment (including writing the question and solution).
2. **Solution writeup**: Draft a writeup similar to GreatFrontEnd's written solution explanations.

_Tip: Refer to [GreatFrontEnd's Lodash JavaScript questions](https://www.greatfrontend.com/focus-areas/lodash) and look at how existing solution code and writeups are written._

**Please attach links to your code and writeups in the job application.**
