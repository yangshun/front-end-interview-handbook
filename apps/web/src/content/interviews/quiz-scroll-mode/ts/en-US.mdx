Preparing for a **TypeScript interview**? You're in the right place.

TypeScript interview questions often blend technical trivia and problem-solving challenges to assess your knowledge of the language's core concepts and advanced features. These questions test your understanding of TypeScript fundamentals, the type system, and your ability to solve real-world problems with strong typing, generics, error handling, and more.

Here are some key areas that TypeScript interviews often focus on:

- **Strong Typing:** Leveraging TypeScript's type system to enforce code correctness and prevent errors at compile time.
- **Generics & Utility Types:** Creating reusable, flexible functions and types using features like `Partial`, `Readonly`, and `Pick`.
- **Type Inference:** Understanding how TypeScript infers types and knowing when to explicitly annotate types.
- **Error Handling:** Managing runtime errors while maintaining type safety using tools like discriminated unions.
- **Testing:** Writing type-safe tests for your code, ensuring reliability and maintainability.
- **Tooling:** Configuring TypeScript projects and integrating with build tools and frameworks.
