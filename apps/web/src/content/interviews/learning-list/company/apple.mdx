Interviews with Apple are highly team-dependent but in general Apple's front end interview process focuses on fundamentals – vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM (Document Object Model). Depending on the team, you might be allowed to use JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue to completed the user interface questions, but you should also be comfortable building user interfaces with just vanilla JavaScript and CSS, without relying on JavaScript frameworks.
