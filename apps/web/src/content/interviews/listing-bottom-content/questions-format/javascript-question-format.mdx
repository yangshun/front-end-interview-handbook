## JavaScript Coding Interview Questions for Front End Interviews

In technical interviews, you may be asked to write utility functions similar to those found in libraries like Lodash/Underscore, create polyfills for JavaScript language features, or manipulate the DOM directly. Mastering these skills is crucial for demonstrating your ability to handle complex coding tasks efficiently and effectively.

Our JavaScript Coding questions are designed to help you develop and refine these essential skills. You'll work on challenges that require you to implement various functions in JavaScript, covering a range of topics from utility functions to polyfills and DOM API manipulation. These questions are aligned with the expectations of modern front end interviews, ensuring that your preparation is both relevant and comprehensive.

### Key Features
