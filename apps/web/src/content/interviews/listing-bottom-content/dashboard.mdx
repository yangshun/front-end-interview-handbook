## Front end interview preparation platform | Get Started

Welcome to our one-stop page where you can systematically find and explore all the resources we have to help you prepare for your front end interviews.

[GreatFrontEnd](/) is the most complete, end-to-end platform for front end engineers to prepare for their interviews. Built by big tech ex-interviewers, every question, solution and test case was written and curated to optimize your front end interview preparation.

### A large, curated question bank

From essential data structures and algorithms to front end interview questions, we've a large practice question bank covering everything you need to ace your front end interviews.

Our large question bank includes:

- Every essential language and framework, including
  - [JavaScript interview questions](/questions/javascript-interview-questions)
  - [React interview questions](/questions/react-interview-questions)
  - [TypeScript interview questions](/questions/typescript-interview-questions)
  - [Angular interview questions](/questions/angular-interview-questions)
  - [Vue interview questions](/questions/vue-interview-questions)
  - [Svelte interview questions](/questions/svelte-interview-questions)
  - [HTML interview questions](/questions/html-interview-questions)
  - [CSS interview questions](/questions/css-interview-questions)
- Every question format, including
  - [Front end JavaScript coding interview questions](/questions/formats/javascript-functions)
  - [Front end user interface interview questions](/questions/formats/ui-coding)
  - [Front end system design interview questions](/questions/formats/system-design)
  - [Front end quiz interview questions](/questions/formats/quiz)
  - [Front end algo coding questions](/questions/formats/algo-coding)
- Every topical area, including
  - [Data structures and algorithms questions](/focus-areas/data-structures-algorithms)
  - [Accessibility interview questions](/focus-areas/accessibility)
  - [Async operations interview questions](/focus-areas/async-operations)
  - [Design system components interview questions](/focus-areas/design-system-components)
  - [DOM manipulation interview questions](/focus-areas/dom-manipulation)
  - [Forms interview questions](/focus-areas/forms)
  - [JavaScript polyfills interview questions](/focus-areas/javascript-polyfills)
  - [Lodash functions interview questions](/focus-areas/lodash)

### Well-explained solutions and source code

Every question on our platform comes with in-depth solutions, including the strategy and approach taken, on top of source code. These solutions, like everything else on the platform, were carefully written by big tech / ex-FAANG senior to staff engineers, who have years of experience interviewing candidates. You may expect high quality solutions with multiple approaches and practical considerations like modularity, accessibility and performance.

### Comprehensive test cases

Every question on our platform also comes with comprehensive test cases, including automated, one-click tests you can run your code against for coding interview questions, and test scenarios for user interface interview questions. Gone are the days of second-guessing if your code is accurate against industry requirements.

### Optimized preparation strategy with GFE 75 and Blind 75

Need an optimized plan of exactly what to study and practice for front end interviews? We have created the Blind 75 equivalent list of questions for front end interviews - the [GFE 75 list](/interviews/gfe75) of questions. GFE 75 is the most essential list of front end interview questions that gets you prepared for 75% of interviews, covering a wide range of critical interview patterns to master.

In the software engineering world, even front end engineers cannot escape from being tested on data structures and algorithms, especially at FAANG companies. To help you with this, we've also solved the [Blind 75 list](/interviews/blind75) of questions in JavaScript and TypeScript, making it more accessible for front end engineers

### The best front end system design material you can find

Front end system design materials are rare enough - deep-dives and good solutions are even harder to find. We've spent plenty of time creating a [detailed guide](/system-design) on tackling them - including the [types of questions](/system-design/types-of-questions) you might face, the [evaluation axes](/system-design/evaluation-axes) you may be judged on, [useful frameworks](/system-design/framework) you can use, and more.

You can also find full solutions and explanations for a long list of front end system design interview questions within the guide, including:

<ul>
  {readySystemDesignQuestions.map((question) => (
    <li key={question.href}>
      <a href={question.href}>{question.title} system design</a>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>

### Company-specific guides and questions

A common strategy used in software engineering interviews, especially while using Leetcode, is to practice for company-specific questions. We have the equivalent for front end interviews, allowing you to spot and practice for specific companies.

We plan to add more companies in the future, but for now, here are the companies you can find in our [Company specific guides](/interviews/company):
