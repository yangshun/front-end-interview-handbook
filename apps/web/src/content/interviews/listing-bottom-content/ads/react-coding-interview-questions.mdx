All solutions are crafted by experienced former senior / staff engineers, ensuring high-quality content that mirrors industry expectations.

### Categories of React Coding Interview Questions

Our questions are divided into two key categories, allowing you to focus on specific aspects of React development:

#### React User Interface Interview Questions

Building dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces is at the heart of React development. This category focuses on:

- **Creating components and widgets:** Practice constructing reusable UI elements such as buttons, modals, and dropdowns.
- **Dynamic interactions:** Solve challenges like creating sortable tables, dynamic forms, and interactive to-do lists.
- **Responsive design:** Learn to design components that adapt seamlessly across devices using React.

**Example question:** How would you build a sortable table component in React?

**Solution and approach:**

1. Use state to store the current sort order and column.
2. Create a function to toggle the sort order and sort data dynamically.
3. Render sorted rows in the table based on the selected column.

```js
function SortableTable({ data, columns }) {
  const [sortColumn, setSortColumn] = React.useState(null);
  const [sortOrder, setSortOrder] = React.useState('asc');

  const handleSort = (column) => {
    const order = sortColumn === column && sortOrder === 'asc' ? 'desc' : 'asc';
    setSortColumn(column);
    setSortOrder(order);
  };

  const sortedData = React.useMemo(() => {
    if (!sortColumn) return data;
    return [...data].sort((a, b) => {
      if (a[sortColumn] < b[sortColumn]) return sortOrder === 'asc' ? -1 : 1;
      if (a[sortColumn] > b[sortColumn]) return sortOrder === 'asc' ? 1 : -1;
      return 0;
    });
  }, [data, sortColumn, sortOrder]);

  return (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          {columns.map((col) => (
            <th key={col} onClick={() => handleSort(col)}>
              {col}
            </th>
          ))}
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {sortedData.map((row, index) => (
          <tr key={index}>
            {columns.map((col) => (
              <td key={col}>{row[col]}</td>
            ))}
          </tr>
        ))}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
}
```

#### React Hooks and State Management Interview Questions

React Hooks and effective state management are critical for creating scalable and maintainable applications. In this category, you'll encounter:

- **Custom hooks:** Learn to encapsulate reusable logic, such as fetching data or managing form inputs.
- **State management with useReducer:** Master managing complex state transitions in larger components or applications.
- **Performance optimization:** Solve challenges related to minimizing re-renders using hooks like `useMemo` and `React.memo`.

**Example question:** How would you implement a custom hook for fetching data?

**Solution and approach:**

1. Use `useState` to manage data and loading states.
2. Use `useEffect` to fetch data from the provided API endpoint.
3. Handle error states gracefully and provide a reusable interface.

```js
function useFetch(url) {
  const [data, setData] = React.useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = React.useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    let isMounted = true;
    setLoading(true);
    fetch(url)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => {
        if (isMounted) setData(data);
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        if (isMounted) setError(err.message);
      })
      .finally(() => {
        if (isMounted) setLoading(false);
      });

    return () => {
      isMounted = false;
    };
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading, error };
}
```
