## React quiz interview questions and answers

React interviews often include a mix of technical trivia and problem-solving challenges designed to assess your understanding of the framework. These trivia-style questions aim to gauge your knowledge of React fundamentals, its core concepts, and how well you grasp advanced features. If you're preparing for a React interview, you're likely to encounter questions that cover a range of critical topics, from component lifecycle and state management to performance optimization, hooks, and testing.

This list of practice questions offers a curated collection of the top React quiz questions commonly asked in interviews. Each question is carefully chosen to highlight the essential areas you need to focus on and is paired with detailed answers crafted by experienced interviewers.

### Why React quiz questions are critical in interviews

Employers use trivia questions in React interviews for several reasons. These questions provide insight into a candidate's depth of knowledge, their ability to think on their feet, and how well they've mastered the nuances of React. While solving coding challenges showcases problem-solving skills, trivia-style questions often reveal how familiar you are with the framework's core concepts and best practices.

In real-world scenarios, understanding React goes beyond just writing components. It's about creating efficient, reusable, and performant applications. Interviewers often ask questions in areas such as:

- **Component Lifecycle**: Understanding how components mount, update, and unmount is essential for managing UI and state.
- **State and Props Management**: Knowing when and how to use props, state, and context to share data across components.
- **Hooks**: Leveraging React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useReducer` to simplify logic and manage side effects.
- **Performance**: Optimizing rendering, using memoization, and handling large datasets efficiently.
- **Testing**: Writing robust tests for React components using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Routing**: Navigating and managing views in single-page applications with React Router.

Being well-versed in these areas not only boosts your chances of clearing the interview but also prepares you for tackling real-world challenges you will face on the job.

### Example React quiz questions

Here are some examples of the types of questions you might face in a React interview, categorized by topic.

#### 1. Component lifecycle

- **Question**: What is the difference between `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`?
  - _Answer:_ `componentDidMount` is invoked once after the component is inserted into the DOM, often used for API calls or subscriptions. `componentDidUpdate` is called after updates to props or state, useful for actions requiring updated DOM data.
- **Question**: How can you handle cleanup in React components?
  - _Answer:_ Cleanup is handled in the `componentWillUnmount` method for class components or inside the cleanup function returned by `useEffect` for functional components.

#### 2. State and props management

- **Question**: What is the difference between state and props?
  - _Answer:_ State is a local data store owned by a component and can change over time. Props are immutable data passed from a parent to a child component to configure or control the child.
- **Question**: How do you manage global state in a React application?
  - _Answer:_ Global state can be managed using Context API, Redux, or third-party libraries like Zustand or MobX.

#### 3. Hooks

- **Question**: How does the `useEffect` hook differ from lifecycle methods?
  - _Answer:_ `useEffect` can replace `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in functional components. It allows combining setup and cleanup logic in one place.
- **Question**: What are custom hooks, and when should you use them?
  - _Answer:_ Custom hooks encapsulate reusable logic that involves state or side effects, making code more modular and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

#### 4. Performance

- **Question**: How can you prevent unnecessary re-renders in React?
  - _Answer:_ Use `React.memo` for functional components, `PureComponent` for class components, or hooks like `useMemo` and `useCallback` to memoize values and functions.
- **Question**: What is React's reconciliation process?
  - _Answer:_ Reconciliation is React's process of updating the DOM efficiently by comparing the virtual DOM with the previous version and applying minimal updates.

#### 5. Testing

- **Question**: What is the difference between shallow rendering and full rendering in testing?
  - _Answer:_ Shallow rendering tests a component in isolation without rendering child components, while full rendering (e.g., using `mount` in Enzyme) renders the entire component tree.
- **Question**: How can you test React hooks?
  - _Answer:_ Use libraries like React Testing Library and tools like `renderHook` from `@testing-library/react-hooks` to test custom hooks directly.

#### 6. Routing

- **Question**: How do you handle navigation in a React single-page application?
  - _Answer:_ Use React Router to define routes and manage navigation with components like `<BrowserRouter>`, `<Route>`, and `<Link>`.
- **Question**: How can you implement route-based code splitting in React?

_Answer:_ Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to dynamically load components for specific routes:

```jsx
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <LazyComponent />
</Suspense>;
```
