## Front end quiz interview questions and solutions

Trivia-style questions are commonly encountered in the early to mid stages of a front end interview, often administered by a recruiter, or companies without technical coding rounds. These questions typically focus on short, factual answers that test how well candidates grasp the theory behind front end development. While it's possible to ace these questions through memorization, a solid understanding of the concepts is essential for long-term success.
