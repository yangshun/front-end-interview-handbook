Curated and answered by ex-FAANG interviewers with years of experience, our resource ensures you're prepared for a variety of challenges. Whether you're tackling algorithms, TypeScript functions, or building robust applications with strong typing, our questions are designed to reflect real-world scenarios. Each question is accompanied by detailed explanations, example solutions, and automated test cases, enabling you to refine your skills with immediate feedback.

Our resource is divided into two major categories: TypeScript Coding Interview Questions and TypeScript Quiz Interview Questions, covering a broad spectrum of topics essential for any TypeScript interview.

### TypeScript coding interview questions

Master critical TypeScript techniques and coding patterns with our curated list of TypeScript coding interview questions. These questions are designed to help you:

1. **Develop strongly typed data structures and algorithms**: Solve challenges involving arrays, tuples, enums, interfaces, and generics, sharpening your problem-solving skills with TypeScript.
2. **Leverage TypeScript's advanced features**: Utilize utility types, mapped types, and conditional types to build modular and reusable functions and components.
3. **Enhance application safety**: Use TypeScript's type system to catch errors at compile-time and ensure code correctness.
4. **Handle real-world scenarios**: Address challenges like API integrations, state management with typing, and designing scalable systems.

Each coding question includes:

- **Example solutions**: Step-by-step implementations written in TypeScript to guide you through the problem-solving process.
- **Automated test cases**: Instantly validate your solutions, ensuring accuracy and correctness.
- **Best practices**: Learn coding techniques that prioritize readability, maintainability, and performance.

Our in-browser coding workspace allows you to practice directly in TypeScript with no setup required. You'll gain hands-on experience with instant visual feedback, enhancing your understanding of TypeScript's features.

Example coding questions you might encounter include:

- How to implement a generic utility function to filter objects based on key-value pairs?
- How to enforce type safety in a Redux store using TypeScript?
- How to design a flexible API response handler using conditional types?

Each challenge mimics real-world tasks, equipping you with practical skills that go beyond theory.

### TypeScript quiz interview questions

TypeScript quiz questions test your understanding of the language's fundamentals and intricacies. These trivia-style questions cover a wide range of topics, ensuring your readiness for interviews. Here's what you'll explore:

1. **Core TypeScript concepts**: Understand key topics such as interfaces, type aliases, generics, and type inference.
2. **Advanced typing**: Learn how to use conditional types, mapped types, and utility types to write concise and powerful code.
3. **Error handling**: Explore techniques to handle runtime errors while maintaining type safety.
4. **Tooling**: Familiarize yourself with TypeScript's configuration options, including `tsconfig.json`, and its integration with build tools.
5. **Testing**: Understand how to write type-safe tests using TypeScript with libraries like Jest and Mocha.

Each quiz question comes with:

- **Concise answers (TL;DR)**: Clear and to-the-point solutions to help you respond confidently during interviews.
- **Comprehensive explanations**: In-depth insights to ensure you fully understand the concepts and can elaborate when required.

Example quiz topics include:

- What is the difference between `interface` and `type` in TypeScript?
- How does TypeScript's `unknown` type differ from `any`?
- How can you use mapped types to create a new type from an existing one?

These questions ensure that you're not only familiar with TypeScript's syntax but also understand how to apply its features effectively in various scenarios.
