## Blind 75 - 75 most important questions for data structures and algorithms interviews

The Blind 75 list of questions is widely regarded as one of the best resources for preparing for technical interviews, particularly in standard software engineering technical rounds.

1. Curated: Blind 75 offers a carefully curated list of 75 coding problems that have been chosen to cover the most common patterns tested in technical interviews. This ensures that you spend their time on problems that are highly likely to appear in interviews.

2. Balanced difficulty: The problems in Blind 75 offer a balanced mix of difficulty that helps in ensuring a smooth progression in building up your topical understanding and problem-solving skills.

3. Coverage of key topics: Problems in the list cover a wide range of essential topics, (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs), algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, dynamic programming), and system design principles.

4. Efficiency: By narrowing down to 75 problems, the list is highly efficient. It avoids the overwhelm of tackling hundreds of problems and instead focuses on the most impactful ones.

5. Reputation and endorsement: Blind 75 has gained strong reputation in the tech community, with many candidates and interviewers recommending it as a go-to. Its effectiveness is supported by countless testimonials from individuals who have used it to land jobs at top tech companies.

6. Consistency with real interview questions: The problems on the Blind 75 list are often similar to those asked in real interviews at major tech companies. Practicing these problems can give candidates a realistic sense of what to expect, helping them to be better prepared and more confident during their interviews.

These factors combine to make Blind 75 highly effective for you and your preparation.
