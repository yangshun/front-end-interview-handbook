In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a responsive interface that enables users to explore images from Unsplash using the Unsplash API. The app should include the following features:

1. **Image gallery**: Displays images in a grid format, with infinite scroll.
2. **Search functionality**: Allows users to search for images using keywords and display search results dynamically.
3. **Downloading images**: Allows users to download images.
4. **API integration**: Integrate with the Unsplash API to fetch images, image details and search results.

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Image listing page

- **Masonry layout**: Implement a masonry layout that dynamically adjusts the number of columns based on screen size.
- **Image hover**: Display the uploader's avatar and image name on hover, as per the designs.
- **Infinite scroll**: Load additional images as the user scrolls or clicks a "Load More" button.

#### 2. Search functionality

- **Search bar**: Implement a search bar that allows users to type keywords and fetch search results from the Unsplash API.
- **Empty state**: If there are no search results for a given set of keywords, display an empty state as per the provided design.

#### 3. Photo details page

- **Navigation**: Clicking on images leads to the photo details page which includes information such as the number of views, upload date, category tags and number of downloads.
- **Download options**: Upon clicking the "Download" button, a dropdown menu of the possible options should be triggered – Small (640px width), Medium (1920px width) and Large (2400px width). The respective heights depend on the original image dimensions. Allow users to download the image in the appropriate resolution.
- **Download feedback**: Provide users with indications of download success and failure using the toast notifications as per the provided design.
- **Related images**: Allow users to view "Related images" to the current image. You are free to decide which images are deemed relevant.

#### 4. Category detail page

- When a category chip (on homepage) or category tag (on photo details page) is clicked, lead the user to the category detail page. Only allow users to select 1 category chip at a time.
- Display images relevant to the selected category in a masonry format similar to the image listing page.

#### 5. API Integration

- **Unsplash API**: Use the Unsplash API to fetch images, handle search queries and download images.
- **Data fetching issues**: If there are issues fetching data, display the data fetch issue state as per the provided design

### General requirements

- **Design fidelity**: Aim to follow the design as closely as possible. All elements in the design should be present, using the specified text color, font size, font weight, spacing, dimensions, etc.
- **Responsive behavior**:
  - **Text size**: Should be responsive; font size is larger for wider devices, smaller for narrow devices.

- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary and using proper `alt` tags for images.
