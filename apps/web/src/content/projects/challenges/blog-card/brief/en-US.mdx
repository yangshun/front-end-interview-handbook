- **Placeholders**: You may leave the redirection links empty for any unspecified buttons or links.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Check that your solution works for major browsers including Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
- **[Stretch goal] Performance optimization**: Optimize image assets and code for quick load times, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **[Stretch goal] Accessibility and semantics**: Follow best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles where necessary, using proper alt tags for images and ensuring that buttons can be navigated to and selected using keyboard controls.
