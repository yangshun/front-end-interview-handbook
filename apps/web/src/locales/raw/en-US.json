Prior to joining GFE, I had no structure to my frontend system design interviews, but after going through the material and following their recommended framework, I passed every single one of my system design rounds. GFE covers frontend knowledge as well as frontend coding very well, their questions appeared in several of my interview loops which helped me not only be fully prepared for all of my interviews, but helped me excel in them.

This means you can seamlessly combine components from various projects to construct unique and customized applications for your portfolio. These components cover a diverse range of applications, including Marketing, E-Commerce, Web Apps, Games, and even Portfolios, which means you'd be able to compose a wide variety of apps from them.",

There are a bunch of different prepping resources for backend roles in the market, but surprisingly, the selection for frontend material is not that great. The frontend coding exercises cover everything you could think of. The best part is that each of them has an editorial/solution section that explains step by step how to tackle the problem and multiple approaches solutions you could take; opposed to other products where you can only find solutions written by random people. Where GFE really shines is on the frontend system design section, even after being 10 years in big tech I’ve never came across such diverse and comprehensive material. I would even recommend GFE to people just trying to become better frontend engineers just for the system design section alone.",

It ended up being a system-design interview, I had 45 mins to build Google Photos (albums and sharing).
