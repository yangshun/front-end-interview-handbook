        GFE helped me take my resume from good to great. Improvements that could
        make the difference between a shortlist or otherwise were brought to my
        notice. The thing I loved the most, was the active effort they took to
        understand my professional experience and goals and tailor my resume
        accordingly. Highly recommended.

        I enjoyed working with GFE to give my resume the boost it desperately
        needed. Through the process, I learned what makes a resume stand out
        when targeting FAANG companies, which was very helpful. I was very
        impressed with how thorough the review was and how they even gave me
        some advice to make my resume much stronger. As an aspiring Android
        Engineer, it was great to have those tips on how to improve my skills
        through side projects. GFE does more than just resume review, they
        really care about your career growth and development!

        GFE clarified a lot of misconceptions I had about the internship search
        & hiring process. They also provided invaluable insights of what FAANG
        hiring managers look for when considering promising candidates. Their
        rapid response times, combined with their concise answers, helped me
        perfect my resume in mere days and land a SDE internship at{' '}

        stands out among the rest!
