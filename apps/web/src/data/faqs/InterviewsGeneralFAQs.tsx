      <p>
        GreatFrontEnd Interviews is excellent for engineers who are preparing
        for front end-focused interviews. Front end interviews have a different
        focus from traditional software engineering interviews as there is more
        emphasis on front end technologies, such as browser technologies,
        solving JavaScript-specific coding problems, building user interfaces
        using frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, and front end client
        architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, even if you are not interviewing, or not officially a Front
        End Engineer, software engineers who develop for the web will still
        benefit from the high quality content and questions authored by our
        senior team of ex-FAANG engineers and interviewers.
