      <p>
        The lifetime plan costs the most but we can assure you it is worth the
        money if you are serious about improving your interview skills and
        landing the job. With a GreatFrontEnd Interviews lifetime membership,
        your premium status will never expire and you retain access to all
        premium interviews content, including future updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        No other platforms offer a lifetime membership and you have to pay every
        time you are job hunting. Consider the number of times you need to job
        hunt in the span of your career. Your lifetime membership will be worth
        it because you can use it for all your future job hunts. If you divide
        the cost by the number of months you will be using it for, the monthly
        cost is very very low.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, we are constantly adding content and prices will increase as
        the amount of content increases. You can lock in access to all premium
        interviews content by purchasing the lifetime plan today.

      Yes, with the exception of the lifetime plan, all recurring subscriptions

      subscribers. Monthly plans are renewed every month, quarterly plans
      renewed every 3 months, annual plans are renewed every year. An email
      reminder will be sent days before the subscription is renewed to give you
      ample time to cancel if you do not intend to renew.

  answer: (
    <>
      <p>
        This is a common issue faced by customers from India and Indonesia
        because some card providers block overseas transactions. If you are sure
        your payment details are valid, you might want to call your bank and
        check if they are the ones blocking the payment. Many of our users have
        resolved the issue by calling up their bank and allowing international
        transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the issue persists, shoot us a email at contact[at]greatfrontend.com.
