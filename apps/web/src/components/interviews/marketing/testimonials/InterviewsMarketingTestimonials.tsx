        "Hi everyone, I got one offer from a big tech company (non-FAANG) and in parts thanks to the resources on GreatFrontEnd. I wish I had learned about this product way before so I had not bombed so many interviews. One fun story to share: I got a job offer for an IC2 role (mid-level) but the salary was low for my needs, so I requested the option to be leveled at IC3 (Senior) and they accepted to make an extra interview, everything happened very quickly, in a couple of days, so I didn't have time to ask what was the interview about so I could prepare. It ended up being a system-design interview, I had 45 mins to build Google Photos (albums and sharing). Thank God, I had reviewed some cases in GFE not long ago, especially the News Feed, which allowed me to completely ace the interview and be leveled as IC3!.",

The frontend coding exercises cover everything you could think of. The best part is that each of them has an editorial/solution section that explains step by step how to tackle the problem and multiple approaches solutions you could take; opposed to other products where you can only find solutions written by random people. Where GFE really shines is on the frontend system design section, even after being 10 years in big tech I’ve never came across such diverse and comprehensive material.

        "I had interviewed at a few startups and had noticed a deviation in the interview landscape away from the classic DSA / Distributed System Style interviews. I was caught off guard by some of the Front-End leaning interview problems, and while I had gotten very close to some offers, I was edged out by other competitors. The bar across the industry was higher than ever, and I had witnessed the brutality of the 2025 market first-hand watching loads of high-performing MAANG engineers get laid off with no notice. When MAANG reached out, I could't afford any liabilities and I had to go all in on the opportunity – I didn't have 6 months to wait to try again if I didn't make it, so this was my Hail Mary. It was \"get this or throw in the towel and go to Law School\". I love engineering and creativity, but I also love financial security. I was on a very limited schedule, as Amazon moved extremely quickly once they had unexpectedly accepted me into the loop. GFE came up in my searches, and appeared to be a one-stop-shop for my best bet at being prepared. I did 100% of the Amazon Prep Guide across a few days. It's the largest pool of problems for a company on the site, by coincidence, and helped me brush off the cobwebs surrounding Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS basics I hadn't really worked with since I first learned to program. Not only did the guide quickly get me up to speed, but the advanced component builds provided a lot of new information and confidence around accessibility, abstraction, and CSS that made me feel like I could exhibit a lot of strength and depth in an interview setting under tight time constraints. This, of course, played out exactly as described . Outside of the Amazon guide, I explored the additional system design questions. I know for a fact that I would have failed this interview without spending time with the system design solutions on GFE. To close, I'll say this: I'm a self-taught SWE, and I actually taught at an amazing bootcamp called LaunchCode that provided free tech education particularly focused towards underprivileged communities. I taught Web Dev basics for many years to thousands, and every semester loads of students would ask: \"Is it really possible to get into FAANG and make that kind of life-changing money for my family? Without having gone to Stanford? Without a degree?\" It took years of hard work and self-driven study, but yes, you can. And if I can do it, anyone can (with GFE).",
