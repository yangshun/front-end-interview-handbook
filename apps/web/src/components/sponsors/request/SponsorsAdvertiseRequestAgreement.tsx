      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>1.1 Ad Slot Booking</strong>
        <br />
        This Agreement governs the specific advertising slot(s) ("Ad Slot(s)")
        that Advertiser has selected via the <strong>Booking Form</strong> on
        Publisher's platform <strong>greatfrontend.com</strong> ("Website"),
        including any details about the advertisement format, start date, end
        date, fees, and creative specifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.2 No Master Agreement</strong>
        <br />
        Each Ad Slot booking is treated as a standalone arrangement under this
        Agreement. Advertiser may book multiple slots in a single submission,
        but a new Agreement will be generated for any separate future bookings.
      </p>
      <p>

          excluding official public holidays in Singapore.
        </li>

        <li>
          Any reference to "days" without the qualifier "Business" refers to
          calendar days.
        </li>
      </ul>

        </li>
        <li>
          Placement will be on the Website pages or sections specified in the
          Booking Form.
        </li>
        <li>
          Publisher reserves the right to modify placement if necessary for
          technical or layout reasons, provided the impact on Advertiser is

        <li>
          The fee for all Ad Slots selected is{' '}
          <strong>USD {totalAmount}</strong>, determined by a{' '}
          <strong>flat-fee</strong> model, updated monthly based on an average
          impression count (at a rate of USD {cpmInUSD} CPM).
        </li>
        <li>

            guaranteed
          </strong>

        </li>
        <li>
          If payment is not received by the Payment Due Date, the Ad Slot is not

        <li>
          Any applicable taxes, if not already included, shall be borne by the

          live, Section 5.2 applies.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the Advertiser resolves the payment issue after the Payment Due
          Date but before the ad slot is taken by another advertiser, Publisher
          may (at its sole discretion) still confirm the slot, subject to
          availability.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there is a chargeback or other payment issue after the Ad Slot has
          gone live, Publisher may terminate the ad immediately unless
          Advertiser resolves the payment issue{' '}
          <strong>within {advertiserResolutionDays} day(s)</strong>. No
          guarantees of slot availability will be made in the interim.

        <li>
          Publisher may terminate this Agreement immediately if Advertiser's ad

          invalidated (e.g., chargebacks) and is not remedied{' '}
          <strong>within {advertiserResolutionDays} day(s)</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

          <strong>pro-rated refund or credit</strong> corresponding to the lost
          advertising time.
        </li>
