## Solution

### Approach 1: Standard method of basic functions

1. Create an empty `results` object to store the group of occurrences of each key.
1. Iterate through the array and determine the key for each element by calling `iteratee(element)`. If the key does not exist within the `results` object, set the value for that key to an empty array. Next, append the element into that key.

### Approach 2: Using nullish coalescing assignment operator

An alternative way to create the `result` object is to use the [nullish coalescing assignment operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_assignment) to set the value to `[]` if `key` doesn't exist within `result`. Note that using nullish coalescing assignment operator means you might be accessing inherited properties, which is not desired, but since the object is created via `Object.create(null)`, there will not be inherited properties and is safe to use.
