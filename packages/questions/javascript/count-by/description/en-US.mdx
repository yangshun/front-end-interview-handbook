title: Count By
excerpt: Implement a function that counts the number of times a value appears in an array based on a function or property name
---

Implement a function `countBy(array, iteratee)` that creates an object composed of keys generated from the results of running each element of `array` thru `iteratee`. The corresponding value of each key is the number of times the key was returned by `iteratee`. `iteratee`s can either be:

- Functions: `iteratee` functions is invoked with one argument: _(value)_.
- Strings: The property of an object. E.g. `'length'` can be used to return the number of elements of arrays.

```js
countBy(array, iteratee);
```

## Arguments

1. `array` _(Array)_: The array to iterate over.
1. `iteratee` _(Function)_: The iteratee function to transform elements. The function is invoked with one argument: _(value)_.

## Returns

_(Object)_: Returns the composed aggregate object.

## Examples

```js
countBy([6.1, 4.2, 6.3], Math.floor);
// => { '4': 1, '6': 2 }

countBy(['one', 'two', 'three'], 'length');
// => { '3': 2, '5': 1 }
```
