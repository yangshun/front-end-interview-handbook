An event-based interaction model is the most common way of building user interfaces. The DOM is also built around this model with the `document.addEventListener()` and `document.removeEventListener()` APIs to allow responding to events like `click`, `hover`, `input`, etc.

## Clarification questions

The following are good questions to ask the interviewer to demonstrate your thoughtfulness. Depending on their response, you might need to adjust the implementation accordingly.

1. Can `emitter.emit()` be called without any arguments besides the `eventName`?
   - Yes, it can be.
1. Can the same listener be added multiple times with the same `eventName`?
   - Yes, it can be. It will be called once for each time it is added when `eventName` is emitted in the order they were added.
1. Following up on the question above, what should happen if a listener is added multiple times and `emitter.off()` is being called once for that listener?
   - The listener will only be removed once.
1. Can non-existent events be emitted?
   - Yes, but nothing should happen and the code should not error or crash.
1. What should the `this` value of the listeners be?
   - It can be `null`.
1. Can listeners contain code that invoke methods on the emitter instance?
   - Yes, but we can ignore that scenario for this question.
1. What if the listener callbacks throw an error during `emitter.emit()`?
   - The error should be caught and not halt the rest of the execution. However, we will not test for this case.

We will handle all the above cases except for the last two cases.

## Solution

### Data Structure

Firstly, we have to decide on the data structure to store the events and the listeners. We can either use:

#### 1. Map of `eventName`s to an array of listener functions.

```js
events = {
  foo: [Function1, Function3],
  bar: [Function2],
};
```

- Pros:
  - Fast lookup of the list of listeners for an `eventName`.
- Cons:
  - Since `eventName` is provided by the user, it can be any value and might conflict with existing keys on `Object.prototype` such as `toString`. We will handle this situation.

#### 2. A flat array of `eventName` and listener pairs.

```js
events = [
  { eventName: 'foo', listener: Function1 },
  { eventName: 'bar', listener: Function2 },
  { eventName: 'foo', listener: Function3 },
];
```

- Pros:
  - Simple, flat structure.
- Cons:
  - Requires O(n) time to find the listeners for an event because you have to look through the entire list of events.
  - `emit()` and `off()` operations will require iterating through the array, you can't instantly determine if an event exists and ignore emission of non-existent events.
  - Potentially more space needed to store the data because of the repeated object fields and `eventName` strings.

Approach #1 is clearly superior, so we will use that. To mitigate the issue of user-provided `eventName`s conflicting with keys on `Object.prototype`, we can instantiate the `_events` object with `Object.create(null)` or use a ES6 `Map` class.

### Implementing `EventEmitter.on()`

Implementing `EventEmitter.on()` is pretty straightforward. Firstly check if `eventName` is present as a key of the `_events` object and make the value an empty array (for the list of listeners for that event) if it is the first time this `eventName` is encountered. Then push the `listener` into the array.

Return `this` so that the method can be chained.

### Implementing `EventEmitter.off()`

First check if `eventName` is present as a key of the `_events` object. If no events with `eventName` exists, we do not need to proceed further and can do an early `return`.

Since we only want to remove the first instance of any matching `listener`, we'll use `listeners.findIndex()` and remove _only one_ instance via `.splice()`, instead of using something like `.filter()` which will remove all matching instances.

Return `this` so that the method can be chained.

### Implementing `EventEmitter.emit()`

Check if the `eventName` exists or has any events and we can terminate and return `false` if the `eventName` doesn't exist or if there are no listeners for `eventName`.

To pass the rest of the arguments to each listener, we have to use `...args` in the method signature to capture all other arguments as the variable `args`. The listeners can be called with `args` via `Function.prototype.apply()` or `Function.prototype.call()`.

### Built-in object properties colliding with user-provided `eventName`s

As mentioned above, if you're using a plain JavaScript object to map `eventName` to callbacks, one potential issue is using `eventName`s that clash with properties existing on JavaScript objects such as `valueOf` and `toString`.

```js
const emitter = new EventEmitter();
emitter.emit('toString'); // Might crash because the property does exist on the object.
```

Two ways to handle this:

- Use a `Map` instead of an object. This is the modern approach.
- Create your plain JavaScript object with `Object.create(null)` so that the object does not have a prototype and no additional properties.

## Edge cases

- The same listener function can be added more than once for the same event. Removal should be done in order of adding.
- `emitter.emit()` is called without any arguments.
- Methods are called with non-existing `eventName`s.
- `eventName`s are built-in object properties like `valueOf`, `toString`.

## Techniques

- Object-oriented programming.
- Using the right data structures.
- Handling of variadic arguments.
- Object chaining.

## Notes

- Arrow functions have a lexical scoping to the `this` context, hence they should not be used as methods on objects as the `this` will not be referring to the object. Thus the `emitter.on()` and `emitter.off()` methods cannot be defined as an arrow function if the return value is the `this` object.
- Node.js' `EventEmitter`'s implementation allows `eventName`s to be symbols which we don't allow here.
