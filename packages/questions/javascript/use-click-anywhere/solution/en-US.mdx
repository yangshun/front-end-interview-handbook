import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import useClickAnywhere from '../setup/src/use-click-anywhere';

## Solution

The `useClickAnywhere` hook can be implemented by making the provided handler function a `click` event listener on the `window` object whenever the component mounts.

`useEffect` is the React hook to use here, and the event listener is added when calling the hook. When adding event listeners, it's imperative to remember to remove the event listener when the component is unmounted. This can be achieved by returning a function within the `useEffect` callback that unsubscribes from the event. This returned function is called when the component unmounts.
