import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import useArray from '../setup/src/use-array';

## Solution

The `useArray` hook can be implemented by storing the array in a `useState` state and defining the utility methods to manipulate the array in terms of the state's setter function with JavaScript's built-in array methods.

Remember to wrap the utility methods in `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of the calling component.

<MDXCodeBlock>{useArray}</MDXCodeBlock>

## Edge Cases

Ensure that the utility methods you implement modify the array in an immutable way since states in React should not be mutated.
