## Solution

### Approach 1: Using `array` to store the union values

This solution iterates through all the array elements, checks if there is any same value in `result` and push if there isn't.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: unionJs, tsx: unionTS }} />

### Approach 2: Use `Set` instead of array

Another solution will be using a set instead of array for `result` as sets can check for existence of items efficiently.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: unionSetJs, tsx: unionSetTS }} />

## Edge cases

If the function is called with non-array arguments, it will throw an error because non-array types do not have the forEach method that the function relies on.

To solve this, we can check if each argument is an array using `Array.isArray` before attempting to iterate over it. If an argument is not an array, you can choose to skip it or add code to process these items separately.
