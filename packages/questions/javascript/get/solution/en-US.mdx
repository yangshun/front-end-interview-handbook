The tricky part of the question is to see that some form of iteration/recursion has to be done on the object to access nested fields.

## Solution

The first step is to split up the path by the delimiter, which is a period. Then we have to recursively traverse the object given each token in the path, which can be done either with `while`/`for` loops or recursions. The looping should stop when a `null`-ish value is encountered.

Array index accessing doesn't require special handling and can be treated like accessing string-based fields on objects.

```js
const arr = [10, 20, 30];
arr[1] === 20; // true
arr['1'] === 20; // true
```

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: getJs, tsx: getTs }} />

## Edge cases

- Bad path inputs like `get(obj, 'a.b..c')` and `get(obj, '')` are unresolved and the `defaultValue` should be returned.
- The solution only works for simple objects. It doesn't work with objects with
  - `Symbol`s as keys.
  - `Map` and `Set` as values.

For these cases you can (and should) clarify the expected behavior with the interviewer.

## Notes

- `null` should be differentiated from `undefined`. Hence we should not use `value != undefined` (which is `false` when `value = null`) to check whether to return the `defaultValue`.
