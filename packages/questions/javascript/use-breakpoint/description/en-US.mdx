excerpt: Implement a hook that returns the current breakpoint name based on the current window width
---

Implement a `createBreakpoint` function takes an object (where the keys are breakpoint names and values are the minimum width), and returns a `useBreakpoint` hook that returns the current breakpoint name based on the current window width.

```jsx
const useBreakpoint = createBreakpoint({
  mobile: 0,
  tablet: 768,
  desktop: 1024,
});

export default function Component() {
  const breakpoint = useBreakpoint();

  return (
    <div>
      {breakpoint === 'mobile' && <p>Mobile</p>}
      {breakpoint === 'tablet' && <p>Tablet</p>}
      {breakpoint === 'desktop' && <p>Desktop</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Arguments

The `createBreakpoint` function takes a key-value pair object where the key is the breakpoint name (`string`) and the value is the minimum width (`number`) in pixels of the breakpoint.

## Returns

The `createBreakpoint` function returns a function that is the actual `useBreakpoint` hook. This hook takes no arguments and returns the current breakpoint name (`string`) that is the closest minimum width to the current window width. Resizing the window will cause the hook to re-run and potentially return a different value depending on the window size.
