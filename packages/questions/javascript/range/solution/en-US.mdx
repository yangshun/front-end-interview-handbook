import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import rangeJs from '../setup/src/range.js';
import rangeTs from '../setup/src/range.ts';

## Solution

Here is a solution that generates the range of sequence from `start` to (but not including) `end` with `step` as increment using only basic functions. Overloaded functions are required in TypeScript as `start` and `step` are optional.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: rangeJs, tsx: rangeTs }} />

## Edge cases

To handle cases where `start` and `step` are not specified but `end` is negative, we can add an if statement to change the value of `step` to -1.
