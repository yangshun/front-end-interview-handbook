## Solution

### Approach 1: Iterate through all predicates and return `false` once any predicate is not fulfilled

1. Iterates over the predicates in the `source` object and ensure if the `key` is not inherited by `source`.
1. Returns `false` if predicate is not fulfilled, and only returns `true` after all predicate are checked to be `true`.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: conformsToJs, tsx: conformsToTs }} />

### Approach 2: Uses `.every()` to ensure all predicate is fulfilled

By using `Object.keys(source).every(...)`, it ensures that to return `true`, every predicate must evaluate to `true` when passed its corresponding value from `object`.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: conformsToAltJs, tsx: conformsToAltTs }} />
