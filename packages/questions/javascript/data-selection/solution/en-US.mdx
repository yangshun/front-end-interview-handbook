This question assesses one's familiarity with JavaScript language.

## Clarification questions

- What is the expected behavior if `options` contains `equipment: []`?
  - It should treat it as `equipment` is not specified at all, but we won't test that case.

## Solution

Let's break the question down into two parts:

1. Filtering the sessions according to the options.
1. Merging the sessions by the `user` field if `merge: true` is present in the `options`.

### Filtering the sessions according to the options

Filtering according to the `user` and `minDuration` is pretty straightforward. We can use basic operators to check if the `user` fields match and whether `duration > minDuration`.

To match the equipments, we have to determine if the `equipment` between the `options` and each session has overlaps. One way is to convert both `equipment` fields into `Set`s so that we can perform lookup in O(1) time. We implement a `setHasOverlap` function to achieve that.

### Merging the sessions by `user` field

This is the tricky part of the question. We have to merge the data for sessions with the same `user` field and also preserve the order. Note the requirement that:

> in the case of merging sessions with duplicate users, the row should take the place of the latest occurrence of that user. The input objects should not be modified.

It would be easier if the question asked for first occurrence of that user as we can push the session into the array and the position will be the correct final position. If we encounter sessions for the same user again, we can update that earlier session without changing its position in the array. Thankfully, an elegant trick would be to reverse the input array first as `reversedSessions` and we can treat it as if the question asked to maintain the order of first occurrence of the user.

We use a new array `sessionsProcessed`, which will eventually contain sessions in the correct order and the merged user sessions. The array will be be the one we operate on when filtering according to the options.

As we iterate through `reversedSessions`, for each session, we see if the `user` has been encountered before. If it is the first time, we add a new entry to `sessionsProcessed`. Otherwise, we update the combined session with the current session data.

To modify the combined session for a user, we create a `Map` (`sessionsForUser`) with the key being the user ID and value being the combined session object. Modifying the combined session object can be done through looking up `sessionsForUser` with the user ID and modifying the value if it exists. The object within `sessionsProcessed` will be updated as well because they are the same object.

## Techniques

- Familiarity with JavaScript data structures like `Array`s and `Set`s.
