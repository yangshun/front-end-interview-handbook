excerpt: Implement a hook that detects user inactivity
---

Implement a `useIdle` hook that detects user inactivity for a specified time. It listens for user interactions like mouse movements, keyboard presses, and touch events, and resets a timer whenever activity is detected.

We consider the user to be idle if there are no events of type `events` dispatched within `ms` milliseconds. Additionally, if the user has just switched from another tab to our tab (hint: the `visibilitychange` event), the user should not be considered idle.

```jsx
export default function Component() {
  const idle = useIdle();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Status: {idle ? 'Idle' : 'Active'}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Arguments

1. `ms: number`: The number of milliseconds to wait before considering the user idle. This defaults to `60_000` (1 minute)
2. `initialState: boolean`: The initial `idle` state. This defaults to `false`
3. `events: (keyof WindowEventMap)[]`: An array of event types that count as user activity. The default value is provided as the `DEFAULT_EVENTS` constant

## Returns

The hook returns a `boolean` value that indicates whether the user is idle or not.
