import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import uniqueWithJs from '../setup/src/uniq-with.js';
import uniqueWithTs from '../setup/src/uniq-with.ts';

## Solution

Here's a solution that filters unique elements based obn a `comparator`. It iterates through the `array`, calls `findIndex` to check for uniqueness based on `comparator`.

1. Create an empty `result` array to store the unique items.
1. Iterate through `array` and check if the current element is unique with items in `result` based on `comparator` using `findIndex`. If `findIndex` gives -1, meaning value is unique, append the element into `result`.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: uniqueWithJs, tsx: uniqueWithTs }} />

## Edge cases

To handle mixed data types, the `comparator` function must be able to process them by either converting the elements to a common type.
