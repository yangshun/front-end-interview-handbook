import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import minByJs from '../setup/src/min-by.js';
import minByTs from '../setup/src/min-by.ts';

## Solution

Here's a solution that finds the minimum element in `array` based on a given `iteratee`. It iterates through the `array`, calls the `iteratee` function with the array element, and tracks the element that produces the minimum value.

Two variables are used:

- `result`: Tracks the minimum element to return.
- `computed`: Tracks the computed value of the current minimum element which will be used to compare with the computed values of subsequent elements.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: minByJs, tsx: minByTs }} />

## Edge cases

Because `iteratee` is user-provided and can return a value of any type, we have to pay special attention to ignore computed values that cannot be compared, like `null` and `undefined`. For such computed values, they should be ignored entirely.

The function should also return the first occurrence of the element that produces the minimum computed value, even though many elements in the array can produce the same minimum computed value.
