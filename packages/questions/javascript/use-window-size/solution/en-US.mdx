import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import useWindowSize from '../setup/src/use-window-size';

## Solution

The `useWindowSize` hook can be implemented using the `useState` hook to store the current screen properties and the [`useLayoutEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useLayoutEffect) hook to update the properties when the screen is resized. We can attach an event listener to the [`resize` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/resize_event) on the `window` object to update the properties state.

`useLayoutEffect` is used instead of `useEffect` to ensure that the size is updated synchronously after the browser has painted. This is important for animations and other visual effects that depend on the window size.

We recreate the `windowSize` object so that the user doesn't accidentally mutate the original object.

<MDXCodeBlock>{useWindowSize}</MDXCodeBlock>
