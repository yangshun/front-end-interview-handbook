This question assesses you on basic DOM traversal APIs and recursion. The approach to solve this question is similar to [getElementsByClassName](/questions/javascript/get-elements-by-class-name).

## Clarification questions

* Do we have to support the `tagName = '*'` case?
  * No, not for this question.
* Will the tag name argument be all lower case?
  * Not necessarily. E.g. `document.getElementsByTagName(element, 'Div')` is valid.

## Solution

The solution is pretty straightforward if you are familiar with the HTML DOM APIs. In particular, we need to know the following:

* `Element.tagName` which returns an **uppercase** string of an element's tag name (e.g. `'DIV'`, `'SPAN'`).
* `Element.children` which returns a live `HTMLCollection` of the child elements. We use this over `Node.childNodes` which returns a live `NodeList` of child `Node`s because `childNodes` will include non-element nodes like text and comment nodes, which are not relevant in this question.
  * However `HTMLCollection` does not have `.forEach`, so we have to iterate through it using traditional `for` loops.

We can maintain an `elements` array to collect the matching elements while recursively traversing the root element. A depth-first traversal is performed.

Remember that the element argument itself is not included in the results.

## Edge cases

* Element argument is not included in the results even if it matches the tag name.
* Non-lowercase tag name arguments.

## Techniques

* Recursion
* DOM APIs
  * How to check an `Element`'s tag name
  * How to traverse an `Element`'s children

## Notes

* `Element.tagName` is uppercase (e.g. `'DIV'`, `'SPAN'`), so be sure to use case-insensitive string comparisons
