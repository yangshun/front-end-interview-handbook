title: Debounce
excerpt: Implement a function to limit how many times a function can be executed by delaying the execution of the function until after a specified time after its last execution attempt
---

Debouncing is a technique used to control how many times we allow a function to be executed over time. When a JavaScript function is debounced with a wait time of X milliseconds, it must wait until after X milliseconds have elapsed since the debounced function was last called.

You almost certainly have encountered debouncing in your daily lives before (e.g. when entering an elevator). Only after X duration of not pressing the "Door open" button (the debounced function not being called) will the elevator door actually close (the callback function is executed).

Implement a `debounce` function which accepts a callback function and a `wait` duration. Calling `debounce()` returns a function which has debounced invocations of the callback function following the behavior described above.

## Examples

```js
let i = 0;
function increment() {
  i++;
}
const debouncedIncrement = debounce(increment, 100);

// t = 0: Call debouncedIncrement().
debouncedIncrement(); // i = 0

// t = 50: i is still 0 because 100ms have not passed.

// t = 100: increment() was invoked and i is now 1.
```

`debouncedIncrement()` is called multiple times.

```js
let i = 0;
function increment() {
  i++;
}
const debouncedIncrement = debounce(increment, 100);

// t = 0: Call debouncedIncrement().
debouncedIncrement(); // i = 0

// t = 50: i is still 0 because 100ms have not passed.
//  Call debouncedIncrement() again.
debouncedIncrement(); // i = 0

// t = 100: i is still 0 because it has only
//  been 50ms since the last debouncedIncrement() at t = 50.

// t = 150: Because 100ms have passed since
//  the last debouncedIncrement() at t = 50,
//  increment was invoked and i is now 1 .
```

## Follow up

- Debounce with a `cancel()` method to cancel delayed invocations and a `flush()` method to immediately invoke them.
- Implement [throttle](/questions/javascript/throttle), which is similar to debounce but a little different.
