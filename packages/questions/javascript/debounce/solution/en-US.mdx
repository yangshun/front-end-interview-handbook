Debounce, along with [throttle](/questions/javascript/throttle), are among the most common front end interview questions; it's the front end equivalent of inverting a binary tree. Hence you should make sure that you are very familiar with the question.

## Solution

Given that there's a `wait` duration before the function can be invoked, we know that we will need a timer, and `setTimeout` is the first thing that comes to mind.

We will also need to return a function which wraps around the callback function parameter. This function needs to do a few things:

### 1. Debounce invocation

- It invokes the callback function only after a delay of `wait`. This is performed using `setTimeout`. Since we might need to clear the timer if the debounced function is called again while there's a pending invocation, we need to retain a reference to a `timeoutID`, which is the returned value of `setTimeout`.
- If the function is called again while there's a pending invocation, we should cancel existing timers and schedule a new timer for the delayed invocation with the full `wait` duration. We can cancel the timer via `clearTimeout(timeoutID)`.

### 2. Calls the callback function with the right parameters

Debounced functions are used like the original functions, so we should forward the value of `this` and function arguments when invoking the original callback functions.

You may be tempted to use `func(...args)` but `this` will be lost if callback functions are invoked that way. Hence we have use `Function.prototype.apply()`/`Function.prototype.call()` which allows us to specify `this` as the first argument.

- `func.apply(thisArg, args)`
- `func.call(thisArg, ...args)`

## Edge cases

The main pitfall in this question is invoking the callback function with the correct `this`, the value of `this` when the debounced function was called. Since the callback function will be invoked in a timeout, we need to ensure that the first argument to `func.apply()`/`func.call()` is the right value. There are two ways to achieve this:

1. Use another variable to keep a reference to `this` and access `this` via that variable from within the `setTimeout` callback. This is the traditional way of preserving `this` before arrow functions existed.
1. Use an arrow function to declare the `setTimeout` callback where the `this` value within it has lexical scope. The value of `this` within arrow functions is bound to the context in which the function is created, not to the environment in which the function is called.

Also, we should not implement the returned function using an arrow function for reasons mentioned above. The `this` value of the returned function needs to be dynamically determined when executed.

## Techniques

- Using `setTimeout`
- Closures
- How `this` works
- Invoking functions via `Function.prototype.apply()`/`Function.prototype.call()`

## Notes

`clearTimeout()` is a forgiving function and passing an invalid ID to `clearTimeout()` silently does nothing; no exception is thrown. Hence we don't have to check for `timeoutID === null` before using `clearTimeout()`.
