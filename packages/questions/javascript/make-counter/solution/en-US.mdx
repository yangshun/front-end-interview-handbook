## Solution

This question evaluates your knowledge on closures and higher-order functions.

### Approach 1: Decrement then postfix increment

1. The `makeCounter` function accepts an optional parameter `initialValue`, which is set to 0 by default.
1. Inside the `makeCounter` function, we declare a variable `count` and initialize it with `initialValue` - 1. We have to declare using `let` since we need to increment it.
1. We return an anonymous function (a closure) that captures the `count` variable from the outer scope.
1. Whenever the returned function is called, we increment `count` then return it.

It's necessary to initialize `count` with one less than `initialValue` because in the returned function we increment before returning. Doing this will allow the first call of the returned function to return the `initialValue`.

<MDXCodeBlock languages={{ jsx: makeCounterJs, tsx: makeCounterTs }} />

### Approach 2: Postfix increment

In the previous solution, it is a little awkward to decrement `initialValue` by 1 only to increment it later. Thankfully we can use the postfix increment operator to increment a variable **after** the value has been returned.

<MDXCodeBlock
  languages={{
    jsx: makeCounterPostfixIncrementJs,
    tsx: makeCounterPostfixIncrementTs,
  }}
/>

### Approach 3: One-liner

We can make the solution even shorter by not initializing a `count` variable and incrementing the `defaultValue` instead. Mutating a function's parameters is usually not recommended due to causing of side effects. However in this case `initialValue` is a primitive and incrementing it will not cause any side effects.

<MDXCodeBlock
  languages={{
    jsx: makeCounterMutateParameterJs,
    tsx: makeCounterMutateParameterTs,
  }}
/>
