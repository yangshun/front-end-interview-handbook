## Solution

Implementing these utility functions won't be an entire interview question itself, but you likely need to implement some of these utility functions as part of solving more complex interview questions.

Most of the functions involve only one line and you might not even need to write a separate function for a single line of logic. The more important thing here is to know how to check for each data type.

It's also important to note the difference between `null` and `undefined`. `null == undefined` is `true`, so we need to use `===` if the intention is to check for exact `null` and `undefined` values.
