**Note:** If you haven't completed the [`Promise.all`](/questions/javascript/promise-all) question, you should attempt that first.

Async programming is frequently tested during interviews. Understanding how `Promise.allSettled` works under the hood will help you in understanding the mechanisms behind similar `Promise`-related functions like [`Promise.race`](/questions/javascript/promise-race), [`Promise.any`](/questions/javascript/promise-any), [`Promise.all`](/questions/javascript/promise-all), etc.

## Solution

There are a few aspects to this question we need to bear in mind and handle:

1. `Promise`s are meant to be chained, so the function needs to return a `Promise`.
1. If the input array is empty, the returned `Promise` resolves with an empty array.
1. The returned `Promise` contains an array of outcome objects in the **same order as the input**.
1. The input array can contain non-`Promise`s.

We'll return a `Promise` at the top level of the function. Firstly check if the input array is empty and resolve with an empty array if so.

We then attempt to resolve every item in the input array. This can be achieved using `Array.prototype.forEach` or `Array.prototype.map`. As the returned values will need to preserve the order of the input array, create a `results` array and slot the value in the right place using its `index` within the input array.

- If a value is resolved, the outcome object has the `{ status: 'fulfilled', value }` shape.
- If a value is rejected, the outcome object has the `{ status: 'rejected', reason }` shape.

To know when all the input array values have an outcome, keep track of how many pending promises there are by initializing a counter of pending values and decrementing it whenever a value is resolved or rejected. When the `pending` counter reaches 0, return the `results` array.

One thing to note here is that because the input array can contain non-`Promise` values, if we are not `await`-ing them, we need to wrap each value with `Promise.resolve()` which allows us to use `.then()` on each of them and we don't have to differentiate between `Promise` vs non-`Promise` values and whether they need to be resolved.

  languages={{ jsx: promiseAllSettledJs, tsx: promiseAllSettledTs }}

Here's an alternative version which uses `Promise.then()` if you prefer not to use `async`/`await`.

<MDXCodeBlock>{promiseAllSettledThen}</MDXCodeBlock>

## Edge cases

- Empty input array. An empty array should be returned.
- If the array contains non-`Promise` values, they will still be part of the returned array if all the input values are fulfilled.

## Techniques

- Knowledge of `Promise`s, how to construct one, how to use them.
- Async programming.

## Notes

- The evaluator does not verify that your input array is resolved concurrently rather than sequentially.
