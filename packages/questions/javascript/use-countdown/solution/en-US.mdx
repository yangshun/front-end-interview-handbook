import MDXCodeBlock from 'MDXCodeBlock';

import useCountdown from '../setup/src/use-countdown';

## Solution

The `useCountdown` hook can be implemented using `useState` to store the current value of the countdown and `useEffect` to manage the countdown timer with `setInterval`.

We just need to make sure we clear the interval with `clearInterval` when the component is unmounted, i.e., on the effect's clean-up.

<MDXCodeBlock>{useCountdown}</MDXCodeBlock>
