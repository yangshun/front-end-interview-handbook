**Note**: This application shares many similarities with the [News Feed system design](/questions/system-design/news-feed-facebook) application and the image carousels within the feed post will benefit from the [Image Carousel system design](/questions/system-design/image-carousel). Please have a read of that question before starting on this. For this question, we will focus on things that haven't been covered, the discussion will be centered around the photos and images.

## Requirements exploration

### What are the core features to be supported?

- Browse a feed containing image and video posts by people a user follows.
- Upload photos, add captions and apply filters to them before posting.

### What pagination UX should be used for the feed?

Infinite scrolling, meaning more posts will be added when the user reaches the end of their feed.

### Is the user able to add captions to individual photos/images or only one overall caption to the post?

Only one overall caption to the post.

### What devices will the application be used on?

Primarily mobile, but should be usable on desktop and tablet as well.

## Architecture / high-level design

### Rendering approach

Photo sharing applications have the following characteristics:

- Posts are viewable by non-logged in users.
- Posts are searchable via search engines.
- Application is interaction heavy due to post composing and liking/commenting functionality on posts.
- Fast initial loading speed is desired.

These are also characteristics of a [News Feed system design](/questions/system-design/news-feed-facebook) where there's a good amount of static content which also require interaction. Hence a combination of server-side rendering with hydration and subsequent client-side rendering would be ideal. In reality, instagram.com is built using the same technology stack as facebook.com which uses React server-side rendering with hydration.

### Architecture diagram

![Photo Sharing Architecture Diagram](/img/questions/photo-sharing-instagram/photo-sharing-architecture.png)

- **Server**: Provides HTTP APIs to fetch feed posts, upload images, and to create new image posts.
- **Controller**: Controls the flow of data within the application and makes network requests to the server.
- **Client store**: Stores data needed across the whole application. In the context of a photo sharing application, most of the data in the store will be server-originated data needed by the feed UI.
- **Feed UI**: Contains a list of image posts and the UI for creating new posts.
  - **Image post**: A post containing a list of one to many images.
  - **Post composer**: UI for uploading images, applying filters to them and adding a caption before submitting to the server.

## Data model

A photo feed shows a list of image posts fetched from the server, hence most of the data involved in the application will be server-originated data. The only client-side data needed is for user-uploaded images and user-written captions in the post composer.

| Entity | Source | Belongs to | Fields |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Feed` | Server | Feed UI | `posts` (list of `Post`s), `pagination` (pagination metadata) |
| `Post` | Server | Feed Post | `id`, `created_time`, `caption`, `image`, `author` (a `User`), `images` |
| `User` | Server | Client store | `id`, `name`, `profile_photo_url` |
| `NewPost` | User input (Client) | Post composer UI | `caption`, `images` (`Image`) |
| `Image` | Server/client | Multiple | `url`, `alt`, `width`, `height` |

Just like in the [News Feed system design](/questions/system-design/news-feed-facebook), a normalized client-side store will also be useful for a Photo Sharing application.

## Interface definition (API)

### Feed list API

Like [News Feed's](/questions/system-design/news-feed-facebook) list API, the photo sharing application's feed list API should also use a **cursor-based pagination approach**.

### Post creation API

All posts in a photo sharing application has attached images. Hence the post creation process in such apps is more complex.

Let's break down the post creation into steps:

1. User selects photos from their device.
1. User is able to perform light edits on their photos: resize/crop/filter.
1. User adds a caption to the post.
1. User submits post.

There are two common ways to implement post creation functionality involving images:

1. Create a single API for both image uploading and post creation.
1. Create separate APIs for image uploading and post creation.

#### 1. Create a single API for both image uploading and post creation

![Photo Sharing API Single Diagram](/img/questions/photo-sharing-instagram/photo-sharing-api-single.png)

Pros:

- Simple to implement, upload all required data in one request.

Cons:

- API logic is more complex because it has to do multiple things on the back end (though that's not really a concern of the front end).
- Upload will take longer because the post images have to be uploaded within one request.
- API has to take in both text-based data and media data.

#### 2. Create separate APIs for image uploading and post creation

![Photo Sharing API Separate Diagram](/img/questions/photo-sharing-instagram/photo-sharing-api-separate.png)

Pros:

- Image upload stage can be done in an async fashion. Images can be uploaded after the image editing stage in the background while the user is drafting the post caption.
- Images can be uploaded in parallel across multiple HTTP requests which is faster than uploading all the images in a single HTTP request which will take longer.
- Can leverage existing general image uploading APIs, if any.

Cons:

- More coordination needed in the client. The client needs to wait for all the images to be uploaded and get a reference to the uploaded images and use them when creating the post.

### Which approach is better?

Comparing the two approaches, the approach of separate APIs would be better.

- **Reusable**: The image uploading API can be a general one that is used across the entire website and not just for the post creation flow, (e.g. profile image upload).
- **Reduced bandwidth**: Practically, blob storage solutions like Amazon S3 and Cloudflare R2 are used for storing static assets like images. Clients can request for a presigned URL and upload directly to the storage buckets without going through the app servers, which reduces bandwidth, leading to lower server costs.

## Optimizations and deep dive

### Feed optimizations

These optimizations done in [News Feed system design](/questions/system-design/news-feed-facebook) also apply to the feed of photo sharing applications.

- Rendering approach
- Infinite scrolling implementation
- Virtualized lists
- Code splitting JavaScript
- Loading indicators
- Preserving feed scroll position
- Lazy load code
- Optimistic updates
- Timestamp rendering
- Icon rendering

### Image carousel optimizations

The images within a post are shown as a carousel, so the [Image Carousel system design article](/questions/system-design/image-carousel) is also useful for this question and the same optimizations apply.

### Rendering images

- Use modern image formats such as [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) which provides superior lossless and lossy image compression.
- `<img>`s should use proper `alt` text.
  - Instagram allows users to provide `alt` text for each image. If the user doesn't specify the `alt` text, Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques can be used to process the images and generate a description.
- Image loading based on device screen properties
  - Send the browser dimensions in the initial request (or subsequent is also fine) and server can decide what image size to return.
  - Use `srcset` if there are image processing (resizing) capabilities to load the most suitable image file for the current viewport.
- Adaptive image loading based on network speed
  - **Devices with good internet connectivity/on WiFi**: Prefetch offscreen images that are not in the viewport yet but about to enter viewport.
  - **Poor internet connection**: Render a low-resolution placeholder image and require users to explicitly click on them to load the high-resolution image.

### Image editing

#### Cropping and resizing

Cropping and resizing of the images can be done via HTML5' `<canvas>`.

```js
const canvas = document.getElementById('image-editor');
const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
const image = new Image();
image.src = 'https://greatimages.com/example.jpg';
context.drawImage(image /* Other parameters */);
```

Instagram website allows editing by simulating the result with inline styles to modify the transform styling and positioning of the image.

#### Filters

CSS provides a [`filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter) property which allows applying filter functions like `blur`, `contrast`, `hue`, `sepia` to name a few. By using a combination of these filter functions, you can achieve Instagram-like filtering functionalities right within your browser.

Here are examples of filter functions to achieve the Clarendon and Gingham filter effects from Instagram, taken from the awesome [Instagram.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/instagram.css/).

```css
.filter-1977 {
  filter: sepia(0.5) hue-rotate(-30deg) saturate(1.4);
}

.filter-brannan {
  filter: sepia(0.4) contrast(1.25) brightness(1.1) saturate(0.9) hue-rotate(-2deg);
}
```

The following images are enhanced right within your browser using these CSS filters.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Original</th>
      <th>1977</th>
      <th>Brannan</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img
          alt="Air Balloon"
          src="/img/questions/photo-sharing-instagram/photo-sharing-air-balloon.jpg"
          width={150}
          style={{
            margin: '0 !important',
          }}
        />
      </td>
      <td>
        <img
          alt="Air Balloon with 1977 filter effect"
          src="/img/questions/photo-sharing-instagram/photo-sharing-air-balloon.jpg"
          width={150}
          style={{
            filter: 'sepia(0.5) hue-rotate(-30deg) saturate(1.4)',
            margin: '0 !important',
          }}
        />
      </td>
      <td>
        <img
          alt="Air Balloon with Brannan filter effect"
          src="/img/questions/photo-sharing-instagram/photo-sharing-air-balloon.jpg"
          width={150}
          style={{
            filter:
              'sepia(0.4) contrast(1.25) brightness(1.1) saturate(0.9) hue-rotate(-2deg)',
            margin: '0 !important',
          }}
        />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Ultimately, the final image still has to be converted into an image blob before sending to the server and this conversion can be done with libraries like [html2canvas](https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas).

### Accessibility (a11y)

#### Screen readers

- `<img>` tags should have a meaningful `alt` description specified or use an empty string.
- Add `aria-label`s to the prev/next buttons within an image carousel.
- Icon-only buttons should have the appropriate `aria-label`s if there are no accompanying labels (e.g. heart, share, bookmark).

#### Keyboard support

- Use the `<button>` HTML tag for the Prev/Next buttons where possible so that the buttons are focusable.
- Add `<div role="region" aria-label="Image Carousel" tabindex="0">` to make the carousel focusable and attach Left/Right keydown handlers to allow scrolling through the images with the keyboard.
