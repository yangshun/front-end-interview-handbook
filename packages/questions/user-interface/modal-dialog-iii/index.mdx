**Note:** This is an advanced version of [Modal Dialog II](/questions/user-interface/modal-dialog-ii), you should complete that question first before attempting this question.

In [Modal Dialog II](/questions/user-interface/modal-dialog-ii), we built a functional modal dialog component that has the necessary [WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/#wai-ariaroles,states,andproperties). For a completely accessible modal dialog component, we should also add the [necessary keyboard interactions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/#keyboardinteraction).

The required keyboard interactions will be done across this question and [Modal Dialog IV](/questions/user-interface/modal-dialog-iv). For this question, the focus is on implementing other convenient ways to close a modal dialog.

## Requirements

The current modal dialog can be dismissed by clicking on the "Close" button within the dialog contents. However, modal dialogs should also support other convenient ways of closing the dialog:

- Clicking outside the modal dialog component (e.g. the overlay)
- Hitting the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key

Add support for these interactions.

## Notes

The focus of this question is on adding closing dialog functionality, not the styling and structure. The solution to [Modal Dialog II](/questions/user-interface/modal-dialog-ii) has been provided here for you to build on top of. You can reuse the existing styling and structure.
