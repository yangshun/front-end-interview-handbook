**Note:** This is an advanced version of [Progress Bars III](/questions/user-interface/progress-bars-iii), you should complete that question first before attempting this question.

In [Progress Bars III](/questions/user-interface/progress-bars-iii), we built progress bars which fill up in parallel, where multiple of them are filling up concurrently, up to a limit of 3. In this question, we'll allow pausing and resuming of the animation.

## Requirements

- Initially there will be one empty progress bar.
- The progress bars fill up gradually in parallel, up to a limit of 3 concurrent bars filling up. i.e. the fourth progress bar will only start filling up after the third progress bar is completely filled up.
- Each bar takes approximately 2000ms to completely fill up.
- Implement the following buttons with the functionality:
  - Start/Pause: Starts/pauses the filling up of the progress bars. The button label turns into "Pause" when the animation is playing.
  - Add: Appends a new progress bar to the bottom of the list.
  - Reset: Resets to the initial state where there is only one empty bar and stops any running animations.
