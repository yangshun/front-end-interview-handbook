## Test cases

- Click on each star and move the cursor away, see that the highlighted state is correct.
- Hover over each star, see that every star under the cursor and to its left are highlighted.
  - Remove cursor over widget, see that the highlighted state is back to before the hovering.
- Render multiple components, ensure that each can maintain its own state and interacting with a widget does not affect other onscreen components.
