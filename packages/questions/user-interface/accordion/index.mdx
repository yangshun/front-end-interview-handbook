Build an Accordion component that displays a list of vertically stacked sections that each contain a title and content snippet. Some HTML is provided for you as example contents along with a chevron icon.

## Requirements

- By default, all sections are collapsed and are hidden from view.
- Clicking on a section title toggles the contents.
  - If the section is collapsed, the section will be expanded and the contents will be displayed.
  - If the section is expanded, the section will be collapsed and the contents will be hidden.
- The sections are independent of each other.

## Example

Try out an [example of an accordion component](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/accordion/accordion.html).

## Notes

- The focus of this question is on functionality, not the styling. Do not spend too much time writing custom CSS.
- You may modify the markup (e.g. adding `id`s, data attributes, replacing some tags, etc) and use client-side rendering instead.
- You may want to think about ways to improve the user experience of the application and implement them (you get bonus credit for doing that during interviews).
