    1. Guess "TOWER". "T" should be yellow, the other letters should be dark gray.
    1. Guess "PLANT". "P", "N" and "T" should be green, "A" should be yellow, "L" should be dark gray. The "T" in the keyboard should now be green.
  - Target word = "APPLE", multiple tries:
    1. Guess "PLANT". "P", "L", "A" should be yellow, the other letters should be dark gray.
    1. Guess "PAPER". The first "P", "A", "E" should be yellow, the second "P" should be green, "R" should be dark gray. The "P" in the keyboard should now be green.

    1. Guess "HELLO". The second "L" should be green, "E" should be yellow, the other letters should be dark gray. The first "L" should be dark gray because "APPLE" only has one "L" and the second "L" is in the correct position.
