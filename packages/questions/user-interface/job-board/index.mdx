Build a job board that displays the latest job postings fetched from the Hacker News API, with each posting displaying the job title, poster, and date posted.

![Job board example](/img/questions/job-board/job-board-example.png)

## Requirements

- The page should show 6 jobs on initial load with a button to load more postings.
- Clicking on the "Load more" button will load the next page of 6 postings. The button does not appear if there aren't any more postings to load.
- If there's a `url` field returned for the job details, make the job title a link that opens the job details page in a new window when clicked.
- The timestamp can be formatted in any way you like.

## API

Hacker News has a public API to fetch jobs by Y Combinator companies. There's no single API that fetches a list of jobs together with the data, so you will have to make separate requests to fetch the necessary data and combine them to be displayed.

### Job Stories

Fetches a list of job posting IDs.

- URL: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/jobstories.json
- HTTP Method: `GET`
- Content Type: `json`

Sample response:

```js
[35908337, 35904973, 35900922, 35893439, 35890114, 35880345, ...]
```

### Job Details

Fetches job posting details given its ID.

- URL: `https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{id}.json`
- HTTP Method: `GET`
- Content Type: `json`

Sample response for https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/35908337.json:

```json
{
  "by": "jamilbk",
  "id": 35908337,
  "score": 1,
  "time": 1683838872,
  "title": "Firezone (YC W22) is hiring Elixir and Rust engineers",
  "type": "job",
  "url": "https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/firezone/jobs"
}
```

## Notes

- The focus of this question is on functionality and not on styling, but feel free to beautify the page.
- To improve the user experience and avoid overfetching, you may want to limit the number of job details fetched to the number of jobs visible on the page.
