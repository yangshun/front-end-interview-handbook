**Note:** This is a follow up to the [Image Carousel](/questions/user-interface/image-carousel) question, you should complete that question first before attempting this question.

Build an image carousel that displays a sequence of images, smoothly transitioning when navigating between images.

## Requirements

- All requirements of [Image Carousel](/questions/user-interface/image-carousel) question should be supported.
- Upon clicking the Prev/Next buttons, the current image should smoothly translate out while the next image enters. Translation direction is left/right respectively.
- Transitions when clicking on the page buttons is optional but highly encouraged. Aim to reuse the transitioning code for the Prev/Next buttons.
- **Recommendation**: Render all the images in a horizontal row within a container and manipulate the horizontal offset of the container to achieve the transitions.

Click on the "See what you are building" button to see a preview of the result.

## Notes

The skeleton code uses the solution of [Image Carousel](/questions/user-interface/image-carousel), but you are free to use your own solution as a starting point.
