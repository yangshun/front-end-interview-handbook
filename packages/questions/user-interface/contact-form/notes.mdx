## Accessibility

- Link `<label>`s to `<input>` so that clicking on the `<label>` will focus on the corresponding `<input>`.
  - Use `<label for="some-id">` and `<input id="some-id">` to define the relation between `<label>` and `<input>`.
  - Avoid nesting `<input>` inside of `<label>` because some assistive technologies (e.g. Dragon NaturallySpeaking) do not support it.

## Follow up

Now that you are familiar with form submission, try out a follow up question, [Signup Form](/questions/user-interface/signup-form), where you will be asked to make an AJAX-based form request and client-side validation.
