## Test cases

- Fields
  - All the fields can be updated.
- Submission
  - Clicking on the submit button triggers form submission.
  - Hitting enter on the fields triggers form submissions if form is valid (except for `<textarea>` which will add a new line)
  - Success alert is seen if all fields are filled during submission.
