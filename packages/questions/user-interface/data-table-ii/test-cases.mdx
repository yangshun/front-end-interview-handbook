## Test cases

1. Initial data sorting
   - Test that clicking on a column header sorts the table by that column in ascending order.
   - Test that clicking on a column header that is already sorted toggles the sorting order.
2. Sorting by different columns
   - Test that sorting by various columns works correctly.
3. Integration with pagination
   - Test that sorting works correctly with pagination. Clicking on the next button should show next page of results while in the current sorted order.
   - Changing the sort column should reset the page to the first.
