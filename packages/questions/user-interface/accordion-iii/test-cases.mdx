## Test cases

- Expanding/collapsing panels
  - When a header is focused, hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> should toggle the associated panel between the expanded/collapsed state.
- Switching header focus
  - <kbd>Tab</kbd> key should focus on the next focusable element,
    which in our example is the next header element. It should
    focus on panel contents if any of them contains focusable
    elements. This scenario is not testable since we only allow
    text contents in our accordion.
  - <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> keys should focus on the
    previous focusable element, which in our example is the previous
    header element. It should focus on panel contents if any
    of them contains focusable elements. This scenario is not
    testable since we only allow text contents in our accordion.
  - <kbd>Up</kbd> key should focus on the previous header element
    and focus on the last header element if the first header
    had focus, skipping any focusable elements within the contents.
  - <kbd>Right</kbd> key should focus on the next header element
    and focus on the first header element if the last header
    had focus, skipping any focusable elements within the contents.
  - <kbd>Home</kbd> key should focus the first header element.
  - <kbd>End</kbd> key should focus on the last header element.
    and focus on the last header element if the first header
    had focus.
