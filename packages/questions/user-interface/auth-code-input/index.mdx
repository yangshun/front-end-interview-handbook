Build an auth code input component that allows users to enter a 6-digit authorization code and submit it.

![Auth code input example](/img/questions/auth-code-input/auth-code-input-example.png)

## Requirements

- Entering input
  - Each input field should only allow one digit between 0 to 9.
  - Entering a valid input will move focus to the next input except when it is the last input.
  - Hitting <kbd>Backspace</kbd> will:
    - Clear the current field if is not empty.
    - Move focus to the previous field if the current field is empty.
  - Pasting should clear all fields and replace the fields with the pasted content.
- Buttons
  - "Submit" button submits the OTP. It is disabled until all the input fields are filled.
  - "Reset" button clears all the fields. It is disabled if all the input fields are empty.
- Submitting the form should make a `POST` request to `https://questions.greatfrontend.com/api/questions/auth-code-input` with a body of `{ otp: '6_DIGIT_OTP' }`.
  - HTTP 204 is returned if the OTP is `'123456'` (the API is hardcoded to only accept this value).
  - HTTP 403 is returned otherwise.
  - Display a success/failure message depending on the response (you can use `alert()`).

These are just the common 2FA basic behaviors, there are more edge cases to consider and we shan't list them all as it is a good practice for you to think through them on your own.

Here's a [decent auth code input example](https://www.luisguerrero.me/react-auth-code-input/) to try out.
