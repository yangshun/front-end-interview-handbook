## Test cases

- Variable text length:
  - Tweets with just a few characters.
  - Tweets which don't exceed a single line.
  - Super long author names and handles. This will take some work to handle, so it is ok not to handle this for now.
- Resize the browser to test rendering on various widths:
  - Narrow width: Renders fine on narrow widths up to 300px.
  - Wide widths: The action row respects the max width and does not stretch across the entire row.
- When there are no counts for an action, the spacing between the icon and the count should not be rendered.
