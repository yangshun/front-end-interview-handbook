title: Maximum Product in Contiguous Array
excerpt: Implement a function to find the subarray which has the largest product
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given an array of integers `numbers`, determine the subarray that has the highest product and return that product.

A **subarray** is a contiguous segment of an array where all elements are taken from consecutive indices, preserving their order, such as `[2, 3]` in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, while non-contiguous selections like `[1, 3]` are not valid subarray.

### Input

- `numbers: number[]`: An array of integers

### Notes

- The test cases are designed such that the result will fit within a 32-bit integer
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `numbers` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `numbers.length` &lt;= 1000
- -10 &lt;= `numbers[i]` &lt;= 10
