title: Extraterrestrial Language
excerpt: Implement a function to verify and return an extraterrestrial language's alphabet order
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

An extraterrestrial language uses the English alphabet, but the letter order is unknown. A list of strings `words` is provided, which represents words from the extraterrestrial language's dictionary, and it is claimed that these words are sorted according to the new language's [lexicographical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order).

If this claim is false, and the arrangement of strings in `words` cannot match any possible letter order, return an empty string. Otherwise, return a string containing the unique letters of the extraterrestrial language sorted according to the language's rules. If multiple valid solutions exist, any of them are acceptable.

### Input

- `words: string[]`: An array of strings where each string is a word in the extraterrestrial language

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `words.length` &lt;= 100
- 1 &lt;= `words[i].length` &lt;= 10
- `words[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters
