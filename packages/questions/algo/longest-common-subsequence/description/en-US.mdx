title: Longest Common Subsequence
excerpt: Implement a function to find the longest common subsequence in two strings

Given two strings, `str1` and `str2`, find the length of their longest common subsequence. If no common subsequence exists, return `0`.

A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the subsequences of `abc` are ``, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ab`, `ac`, `bc`, and `abc`.

A common subsequence between two strings refers to a subsequence that appears in both string sequences in the same relative order. For example, in the strings `xyz` and `axabz`, the longest common subsequence is `xz`, and therefore, the length of the longest common subsequence is 2.

### Input

- `str1: string`: A string
- `str2: string`: A string

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `str1.length`, `str2.length` &lt;= 1000
- `str1` and `str2` consist of only lowercase English characters
