title: Binary Tree Equal
excerpt: Implement a function to determine whether two binary trees are equal
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given the root nodes of two binary trees, `a` and `b`, determine whether the two trees are equal.

Two binary trees are considered equal if they have the same structure and the corresponding nodes in both trees have the same values.

The binary tree is represented by a collection of `TreeNode`s, where each node has optional `left` and `right` child nodes, which are also `TreeNode`s.

A `TreeNode` has the following interface:

```ts
interface TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

### Input

- `a: TreeNode`: Root node of the first tree. Examples display a [level-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) of the tree
- `b: TreeNode`: Root node of the second tree. Examples display a [level-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) of the tree

### Constraints

- 0 &lt;= Number of nodes &lt;= 100
- -10,000 &lt;= `TreeNode.val` &lt;= 10,000
