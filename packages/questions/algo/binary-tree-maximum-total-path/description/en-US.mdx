title: Binary Tree Maximum Total Path
excerpt: Implement a function to find the maximum total of nodes in a binary tree path

Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine the maximum possible sum of any non-empty path within the tree.

In a binary tree, a path is defined as a sequence of nodes where each consecutive pair of nodes in the sequence is directly connected by an edge. A node can appear in the path sequence only once, and the path does not necessarily need to include the root. The sum of a path is calculated by adding up the values of all nodes present in that path.

The binary tree is represented by a collection of `TreeNode`s, where each node has optional `left` and `right` child nodes, which are also `TreeNode`s.

A `TreeNode` has the following interface:

```ts
interface TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

### Input

- `root: TreeNode`: Root node of the tree. Examples display a [level-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) of the tree

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= Number of nodes &lt;= 10,000
- -100 &lt;= `TreeNode.val` &lt;= 100
