import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

An experienced robber aims to steal the money in the houses on a street. Each house has a certain amount of money hidden, but there is a catch: the security systems in adjacent houses are interconnected. If the robber breaks into two neighboring houses, the police will be alerted.

Given an array of integers `numbers` where each element represents the amount of money in a house, determine the maximum amount of money the robber can steal without triggering the alarm.

### Input

- `numbers: number[]`: An array of integers

### Notes

- The robber cannot steal from two adjacent houses

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `numbers.length` &lt;= 100
- 0 &lt;= `numbers[i]` &lt;= 400
