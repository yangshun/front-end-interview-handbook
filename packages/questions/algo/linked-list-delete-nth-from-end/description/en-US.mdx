title: Delete Nth Node from End of Linked List
excerpt: Implement a function to delete the nth node from the end of a linked list
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given the head of a [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), delete the `n-th` node from the end of the list and return the updated head.

The linked list is represented by a sequence of `ListNode`s, where each node points to the next node in the sequence, or `null` if it is the last node.

A `ListNode` has the following interface:

```ts
interface ListNode {
  val: number;
  next: ListNode | null;
}
```

### Input

- `head: ListNode`: Head of the linked list. Examples display each linked list as an array of values within the list
- `n: number`: An integer indicating the position (from the end) of the node to delete

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= Number of nodes &lt;= 1000
- 1 &lt;= `ListNode.val` &lt;= 1000
