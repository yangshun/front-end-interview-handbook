title: Most Common Elements
excerpt: Implement a function to determine the most common elements in an integer array
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given an array of integers `numbers` and a number `k`, find the `k` most frequent numbers in the array. Here, `k` represents the number of elements that should be returned, which are the ones that appear the most frequently. The order of the result does not matter.

### Input

- `numbers: number[]`: An array of integers
- `k`: An integer

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `numbers.length` &lt;= 1000
- -10,000 &lt;= `numbers[i]` &lt;= 10,000
- 1 &lt;= `k` &lt;= Number of unique elements in `numbers`
- The solution is guaranteed to have a unique result
