The prerequisite relationships are as follows: course 1 requires course 0 to be completed first, course 2 requires course 1, course 3 requires course 2, and course 1 requires course 3. This creates a circular dependency: course 1 depends on course 3, which in turn depends on course 2, which then depends on course 1 again. Since it is impossible to break this cycle and complete all courses, the output is false."

    "explanation": "The prerequisite [1, 0] indicates that course 0 must be completed before course 1. Since there are no other dependencies or cycles, it is straightforward to complete the courses in the order: course 0, then course 1. Therefore, the output is true."
