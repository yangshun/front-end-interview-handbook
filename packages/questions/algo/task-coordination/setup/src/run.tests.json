Since there is a cooldown of 2, we need to ensure that after every 'A' there are at least 2 other tasks or idle intervals before we can add another 'A'. The same applies to 'B'. A valid sequence might look like this: 'A' -> 'B' -> idle -> 'A' -> 'B' -> idle -> 'A' -> 'B'. Thus, the total number of intervals required is 8."

    "explanation": "The tasks 'A', 'B', and 'C' appear multiple times, but the cooldown is only 1. After completing one 'A', we can immediately complete another 'A' after just one other task. A valid sequence could look like this: 'A' -> 'C' -> 'A' -> 'B' -> 'D' -> 'B'. Thus, the total number of intervals required is 6."
