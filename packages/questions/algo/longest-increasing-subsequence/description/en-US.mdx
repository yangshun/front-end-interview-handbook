title: Longest Increasing Subsequence
excerpt: Implement a function to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given an array of integers `numbers`, determine the length of the longest subsequence in which each number is strictly greater than the one before it.

A **subsequence** is a sequence derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the subsequences of `[1, 2, 3]` are `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[1, 2]`, `[2, 3]`, `[1, 3]`, and `[1, 2, 3]`.

### Input

- `numbers: number[]`: An array of integers

<MDXTestExamples testCases={runTestCases} />

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= `numbers.length` &lt;= 2500
- -10,000 &lt;= `numbers[i]` &lt;= 10,000
