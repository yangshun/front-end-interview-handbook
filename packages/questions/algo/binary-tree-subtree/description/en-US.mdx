title: Binary Tree Subtree
excerpt: Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a subtree of another binary tree
---

import MDXTestExamples from 'MDXTestExamples';
import runTestCases from '../setup/src/run.tests.json';

Given the roots of two binary trees, `root` and `subRoot`, determine whether `subRoot` is a subtree of `root`. The function should return `true` if there exists a subtree within `root` that has the same structure and node values as `subRoot`. If no such subtree exists, return `false`.

### Notes

- A subtree is defined as a portion of a binary tree that includes a node and all of its descendants
- A tree can be considered a subtree of itself

The binary tree is represented by a collection of `TreeNode`s, where each node has optional `left` and `right` child nodes, which are also `TreeNode`s.

A `TreeNode` has the following interface:

```ts
interface TreeNode {
  val: number;
  left: TreeNode | null;
  right: TreeNode | null;
}
```

### Input

- `root: TreeNode`: Root node of the tree. Examples display a [level-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) of the tree
- `subRoot: TreeNode`: Root node of the subtree. Examples display a [level-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) of the tree

### Constraints

- 1 &lt;= Number of nodes &lt;= 100
- -10,000 &lt;= `TreeNode.val` &lt;= 10,000
