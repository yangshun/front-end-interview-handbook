Unlike coding and quiz questions, system design interviews are open-ended style interviews where there are no right answers. You're given a vague problem or scenario and you're expected to work with the interviewer to answer the question by coming up with a suitable software design on a whiteboard, or some collaborative drawing app if it's a virtual interview. It is similar to the process at certain companies where engineers write technical design documents to outline the possible approaches to a project they are working on, explain technical decisions and discuss tradeoffs with coworkers except that you have to do it within 30-60 minutes.

System design interviews are usually given to candidates who have some number of years of working experience (aka non-fresh grads) and your performance in the system design interview has significant influence on the job level you will be offered. Most of the time, failing the system design interview will result in an overall rejection. It's really important to ace your system design interviews!

However, given the open-ended nature of system design interviews, it is much harder to practice for it as compared to coding interviews. Many candidates also don't have real life experience building various systems and it's hard to draw from experience when answering system design interview questions. Also, there are very few resources available for front end system design. Most existing system design resources are targeted at general Software Engineers and hence focus on distributed systems.

GreatFrontEnd's front end system design resources are perhaps the most comprehensive you can find and will help you ace your front end system design interviews with ease!

## Front end vs Back end / Full stack system design

In traditional Software Engineer system design interviews, candidates will be asked to describe the architecture of a distributed system, usually involving web servers, API gateways, load balancers, caches, databases, microservices, message queues, streams, etc.

For Front End Engineers, system design interviews are slightly different â€“ there's more emphasis on what goes on in the client and API design between the client and the server, as opposed to what goes on in the back end.

| Area | Back end / Full stack | Front end |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gather requirements | Required | Required |
| Architecture / High-level design entities | Distributed cloud services | Application/Component |
| Back-of-the-envelope estimation | May be required | Not required |
| Components of the system | Cloud services (e.g. Load balancer, Application server, Database, File storage, Caches, Message queues, CDN, Full-text search) | Application modules (Model, View, Controller) |
| Data model | Database schema | Application state |
| Type of APIs between components | Network (Any protocol) | Network (HTTP, WebSocket), JavaScript functions |
| Deep dives / focus areas | Scalability, Reliability, Consistency, Availability | Performance, User Experience, Accessibility, Internationalization |
| Less important (Can treat as a black box) | Client | Server |

For example, a classic question is to ask about designing a Facebook news feed which can be asked during both back end and front end system interviews.

- **Back end / Full stack**: Capacity estimation, designing the database schema, APIs between microservices, how to ensure the services can scale with the traffic, how to generate a user's news feed in a scalable fashion, what happens when a post is created by a typical user (hundreds of followers) vs celebrities (millions of followers)
- **Front end**: HTTP API for the feed, how to implement feed pagination, how to implement interactions with posts, how new posts can be created, user experience and accessibility considerations

As you can see, the focus of front end system design interviews can be very different from back end, and answering them well requires a different approach.
