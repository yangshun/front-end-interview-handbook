title: Have you played around with the new CSS Flexbox or Grid specs?
---

Flexbox is mainly meant for 1-dimensional layouts while Grid is meant for 2-dimensional layouts.

Flexbox solves many common problems in CSS, such as vertical centering of elements within a container, sticky footer, etc. famous CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Bulma are based on Flexbox, and Flexbox is still the tested and proven way to create a variety of layouts.

Grid is meant for two-dimensional layouts, giving you full control over both rows and columns. It offers an intuitive and powerful way to create complex grid-based designs directly in CSS, often with less code and more flexibility than older techniques. Browser support for Grid is now strong across all major modern browsers, making it a solid option for layout design in most projects.
