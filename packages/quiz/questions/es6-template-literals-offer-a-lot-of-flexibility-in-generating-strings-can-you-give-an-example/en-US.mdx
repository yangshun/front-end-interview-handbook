title: ES2015 Template Literals offer a lot of flexibility in generating strings, can you give an example?
---

Template literals help make it simple to do string interpolation, or to include variables in a string. Before ES2015, it was common to do something like this:

```js
var person = {name: 'Tyler', age: 28};
console.log(
  'Hi, my name is ' + person.name + ' and I am ' + person.age + ' years old!',
);
// 'Hi, my name is Tyler and I am 28 years old!'
```

With template literals, you can now create that same output like this instead:

```js
const person = {name: 'Tyler', age: 28};
console.log(`Hi, my name is ${person.name} and I am ${person.age} years old!`);
// 'Hi, my name is Tyler and I am 28 years old!'
```

Note that you use backticks, not quotes, to indicate that you are using a template literal and that you can insert expressions inside the `${}` placeholders.

A second helpful use case is in creating multi-line strings. Before ES2015, you could create a multi-line string like this:

```js
console.log('This is line one.\nThis is line two.');
// This is line one.
// This is line two.
```

Or if you wanted to break it up into multiple lines in your code so you didn't have to scroll to the right in your text editor to read a long string, you could also write it like this:

```js
console.log('This is line one.\n' + 'This is line two.');
// This is line one.
// This is line two.
```

Template literals, however, preserve whatever spacing you add to them. For example, to create that same multi-line output that we created above, you can simply do:

```js
console.log(`This is line one.
This is line two.`);
// This is line one.
// This is line two.
```

Another use case of template literals would be to use as a substitute for templating libraries for simple variable interpolations:

```js
const person = {name: 'Tyler', age: 28};
document.body.innerHTML = `
  <div>
    <p>Name: ${person.name}</p>
    <p>Age: ${person.age}</p>
  </div>
`;
```

**Note that your code may be susceptible to XSS by using `.innerHTML`. Sanitize your data before displaying it if it came from a user!**
