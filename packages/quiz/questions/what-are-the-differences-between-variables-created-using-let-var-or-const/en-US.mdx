title: What are the differences between variables created using `let`, `var` or `const`?
---

Variables declared using the `var` keyword are scoped to the function in which they are created, or if created outside of any function, to the global object. `let` and `const` are _block scoped_, meaning they are only accessible within the nearest set of curly braces (function, if-else block, or for-loop).

```js
function foo() {
  // All variables are accessible within functions.
  var bar = 'bar';
  let baz = 'baz';
  const qux = 'qux';

  console.log(bar); // bar
  console.log(baz); // baz
  console.log(qux); // qux
}

console.log(bar); // ReferenceError: bar is not defined
console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: baz is not defined
console.log(qux); // ReferenceError: qux is not defined
```

```js
if (true) {
  var bar = 'bar';
  let baz = 'baz';
  const qux = 'qux';
}

// var declared variables are accessible anywhere in the function scope.
console.log(bar); // bar
// let and const defined variables are not accessible outside of the block they were defined in.
console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: baz is not defined
console.log(qux); // ReferenceError: qux is not defined
```

`var` allows variables to be hoisted, meaning they can be referenced in code before they are declared. `let` and `const` will not allow this, instead throwing an error.

```js
console.log(foo); // undefined

var foo = 'foo';

console.log(baz); // ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'baz' before initialization

let baz = 'baz';

console.log(bar); // ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'bar' before initialization

const bar = 'bar';
```

Redeclaring a variable with `var` will not throw an error, but `let` and `const` will.

```js
var foo = 'foo';
var foo = 'bar';
console.log(foo); // "bar"

let baz = 'baz';
let baz = 'qux'; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'baz' has already been declared
```

`let` and `const` differ in that `let` allows reassigning the variable's value while `const` does not.

```js
// This is fine.
let foo = 'foo';
foo = 'bar';

// This causes an exception.
const baz = 'baz';
baz = 'qux';
```

## Notes

- Since most browsers support `let` and `const` these days, using `var` is no longer recommended. If you need to target older browsers, write your code using `let`, and use a transpiler like Babel to compile your code to older syntax.
