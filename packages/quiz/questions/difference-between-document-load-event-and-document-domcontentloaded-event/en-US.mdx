title: Difference between document `load` event and document `DOMContentLoaded` event?
---

The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

`window`'s `load` event is only fired after the DOM and all dependent resources and assets have loaded.
