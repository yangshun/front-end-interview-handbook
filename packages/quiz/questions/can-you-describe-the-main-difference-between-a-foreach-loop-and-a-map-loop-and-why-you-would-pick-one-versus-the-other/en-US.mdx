title: Can you describe the main difference between a `.forEach` loop and a `.map()` loop?
subtitle: Why you would pick one versus the other?

To understand the differences between the two, let's look at what each function does.

## `forEach`

- Iterates through the elements in an array.
- Executes a callback for each element.
- Does not return a value.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = a.forEach((num, index) => {
  // Do something with num and/or index.
});

// doubled = undefined
```

## `map`

- Iterates through the elements in an array.
- "Maps" each element to a new element by calling the function on each element, creating a new array as a result.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = a.map((num) => {
  return num * 2;
});

// doubled = [2, 4, 6]
```

The main difference between `.forEach` and `.map()` is that `.map()` returns a new array. If you need the result, but do not wish to mutate the original array, `.map()` is the clear choice. If you simply need to iterate over an array, `forEach` is a fine choice.
