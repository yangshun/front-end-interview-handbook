title: What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?
---

## TL;DR

Anonymous function in Javascript is a function that does not have any name associated with it. They are typically used as arguments to other functions or assigned to variables.

```js
// The filter method is passed an anonymous function.
arr.filter((x) => x > 1);
```

They are often used as arguments to other functions, known as higher-order functions, which can take functions as input and return a function as output. Anonymous functions can access variables from the outer scope, a concept known as closures, allowing them to "close over" and remember the environment in which they were created.

```js
// Encapsulating Code
(function () {
  // Some code here.
})();

// Callbacks
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}, 1000);

// Functional programming constructs
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const double = arr.map(function (el) {
  return el * 2;
});
console.log(double); // [2, 4, 6]
```

## Anonymous functions

Anonymous functions provide a more concise way to define functions, especially for simple operations or callbacks. Besides that, they can also be used in the following scenarios

### Immediate execution

Anonymous functions are commonly used in Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs) to encapsulate code within a local scope. This prevents variables declared within the function from leaking to the global scope and polluting the global namespace.

```js
// This is an IIFE
(function () {
  var x = 10;
  console.log(x); // 10
})();

// x is not accessible here
console.log(typeof x); // undefined
```

In the above example, the IIFE creates a local scope for the variable `x`. As a result, `x` is not accessible outside the IIFE, thus preventing it from leaking into the global scope.

### Callbacks

Anonymous functions can be used as callbacks that are used once and do not need to be used anywhere else. The code will seem more self-contained and readable when handlers are defined right inside the code calling them, rather than having to search elsewhere to find the function body.

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}, 1000);
```

### Higher-order functions

It is used as arguments to functional programming constructs like Higher-order functions or Lodash (similar to callbacks). Higher-order functions take other functions as arguments or return them as results. Anonymous functions are often used with higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const double = arr.map((el) => {
  return el * 2;
});
console.log(double); // [2, 4, 6]
```

### Event Handling

In React, anonymous functions are widely used for defining callback functions inline for handling events and passing callbacks as props.

```jsx
function App() {
  return <button onClick={() => console.log('Clicked!')}>Click Me</button>;
}
```
