title: Can you offer a use case for the new arrow => function syntax?
subtitle: How does this new syntax differ from other functions?

One obvious benefit of arrow functions is to simplify the syntax needed to create functions, without a need for the `function` keyword. The `this` within arrow functions is also bound to the enclosing scope which is different compared to regular functions where the `this` is determined by the object calling it. Lexically-scoped `this` is useful when invoking callbacks especially in React components.
