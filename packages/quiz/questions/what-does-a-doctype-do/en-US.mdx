title: What does a `DOCTYPE` do?
---

**DOCTYPE** is an abbreviation for **Document Type**. A DOCTYPE is always associated to a **DTD** - for **Document Type Definition**.

A DTD defines how documents of a certain type should be structured (i.e. a `button` can contain a `span` but not a `div`), whereas a DOCTYPE declares what DTD a document _supposedly_ respects (i.e. this document respects the HTML DTD).

For webpages, the DOCTYPE declaration is required. It is used to tell user agents what version of the HTML specifications your document respects. Once a user agent has recognized a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the **no-quirks mode** matching this DOCTYPE for reading the document. If a user agent doesn't recognize a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the **quirks mode**.

The DOCTYPE declaration for the HTML5 standards is `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

Why It Matters:
Without DOCTYPE:

Box model calculations differ
CSS rendering inconsistencies
JavaScript behavior variations
Layout problems across browsers

With Proper DOCTYPE:

Predictable CSS box model
Consistent rendering
Modern HTML5 features work properly
Better cross-browser compatibility
