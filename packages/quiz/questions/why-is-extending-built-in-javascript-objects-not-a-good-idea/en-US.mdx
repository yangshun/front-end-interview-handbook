title: Why is extending built-in JavaScript objects not a good idea?
---

## TL;DR

Extending a built-in/native JavaScript object means adding properties/functions to its `prototype`. While this may seem like a good idea at first, it is dangerous in practice. Imagine your code uses a few libraries that both extend the `Array.prototype` by adding the same `contains` method, the implementations will overwrite each other and your code will break if the behavior of these two methods is not the same.

The only time you may want to extend a native object is when you want to create a polyfill, essentially providing your own implementation for a method that is part of the JavaScript specification but might not exist in the user's browser due to it being an older browser.

In JavaScript it's very easy to extend a built-in/native object. You can simply extend a built-in object by adding properties and functions to its `prototype`.

```js
String.prototype.reverseString = function () {
  return this.split('').reverse().join('');
};

console.log('hello world'.reverseString()); // Outputs 'dlrow olleh'

// instead of extending the built in object you can write a simple utility function to do it

function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}

console.log(reverseString('hello world')); // Outputs 'dlrow olleh'
```

### Disadvantages

It is not recommended to extend built-in objects. Extending built-in JavaScript objects can have several disadvantages:

1. **Future Proofing**: If a browser decides to implement its own version of a method, your custom extension might get overridden silently, leading to unexpected behavior or conflicts.
2. **Collisions**: Adding custom methods to built-in objects can lead to collisions with future browser implementations or other libraries, causing unexpected behavior or errors.
3. **Maintenance and Debugging**: When extending built-in objects, it can be difficult for other developers to understand the changes made, making maintenance and debugging more challenging.
4. **Performance**: Extending built-in objects can potentially impact performance, especially if the extensions are not optimized for the specific use case.
5. **Security**: In some cases, extending built-in objects can introduce security vulnerabilities if not done correctly, such as adding enumerable properties that can be exploited by malicious code.
6. **Compatibility**: Custom extensions to built-in objects may not be compatible with all browsers or environments, leading to issues with cross-browser compatibility.
7. **Namespace Clashes**: Extending built-in objects can lead to namespace clashes if multiple libraries or scripts extend the same object in different ways, causing conflicts and unexpected behavior.

### Alternatives to extending built-in objects:

1. **Create custom utility functions**: For simple tasks, creating small utility functions specific to your needs can be a cleaner and more maintainable solution.
2. **Use libraries and frameworks**: Many libraries and frameworks provide their own helper methods and extensions, eliminating the need to modify built-in objects directly.

## Summery

Many developers and experts recommend against extending built-in objects due to these potential issues and instead suggest using composition or creating custom classes and utility functions to achieve the desired functionality.
