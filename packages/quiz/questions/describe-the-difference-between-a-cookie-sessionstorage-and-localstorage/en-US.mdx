title: Describe the difference between a cookie, `sessionStorage` and `localStorage`.
---

## Similarities

Cookies, `localStorage`, and `sessionStorage`, are all:

- Storage mechanisms on the client side. This means the clients can read and modify the values.
- Key-value based storage.
- They are only able to store values as strings. Objects will have to be serialized into a string (`JSON.stringify()`) in order to be stored.

## Differences

|  | Cookie | `localStorage` | `sessionStorage` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Initiator | Client or server. Server can use `Set-Cookie` header | Client | Client |
| Expiry | Manually set | Forever | On tab close |
| Persistent across browser sessions | Depends on whether expiration is set | Yes | No |
| Sent to server with every HTTP request | Cookies are automatically being sent via `Cookie` header | No | No |
| Capacity (per domain) | 4kb | 5MB | 5MB |
| Access | Any window | Any window | Same tab |

There are also other client-side storage mechanisms like [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) which is more powerful than the above-mentioned technologies but more complicated to use.
