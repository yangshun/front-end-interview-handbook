title: Describe event bubbling
---

When an event triggers on a DOM element, it will attempt to handle the event if there is a listener attached, then the event is bubbled up to its parent and the same thing happens. This bubbling occurs up the element's ancestors all the way to the `document`. Event bubbling is the mechanism behind event delegation. To prevent event bubbling, you can use `event.stopPropagation()`.
