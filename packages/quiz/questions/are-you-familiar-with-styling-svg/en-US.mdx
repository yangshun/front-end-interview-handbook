title: Understanding SVG in Simple Terms
---

**SVG** stands for **Scalable Vector Graphics**. It‚Äôs a way to create images using text (XML code) instead of pixels. Unlike JPEG or PNG images, which are made of fixed pixels, SVGs are made of shapes (like lines, circles, rectangles, and paths).  

Because SVGs are vector-based, they can be scaled up or down infinitely **without losing quality**. That makes them perfect for logos, icons, and illustrations that need to look sharp at any size.

## Example

Here‚Äôs a simple red circle written in SVG:

```html
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="red" />
</svg>
````

* `<svg>` ‚Üí container
* `<circle>` ‚Üí draws a circle
* `cx="50" cy="50"` ‚Üí center of the circle
* `r="40"` ‚Üí radius
* `fill="red"` ‚Üí color

Put this inside an HTML page and you‚Äôll see a red circle üéØ

## Key Features of SVG

1. **Scalable** ‚Äì zoom in/out infinitely with no blur.
2. **Text-based** ‚Äì editable with any text editor.
3. **Lightweight** ‚Äì smaller file sizes for simple graphics.
4. **Stylable** ‚Äì colors, borders, and effects can be changed with CSS.
5. **Interactive** ‚Äì parts of the SVG can be clickable or animated with JavaScript.

## Styling SVG with CSS

SVG elements support CSS styling. For example, you can change a circle‚Äôs color when hovering:

```css
circle {
  fill: red;
  transition: fill 0.3s;
}
circle:hover {
  fill: blue;
}
```

## Common Use Cases

* Website icons and logos
* Charts and graphs (e.g., with d3.js)
* Animations and loading spinners
* Diagrams and illustrations
* Interactive maps

## SVG vs PNG/JPEG

| Feature   | SVG üñºÔ∏è                   | PNG/JPEG üñºÔ∏è           |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Type      | Vector (shapes)           | Raster (pixels)        |
| Scaling   | Infinite, no blur         | Blurry when zoomed     |
| File size | Small (for simple shapes) | Can be large           |
| Best for  | Icons, logos, charts      | Photos, complex images |

## Summary

* SVG = vector graphics in XML text.
* Scales infinitely with no loss of quality.
* Can be styled, animated, and made interactive.
* Best choice for icons, logos, charts, and simple graphics (not for photos).
