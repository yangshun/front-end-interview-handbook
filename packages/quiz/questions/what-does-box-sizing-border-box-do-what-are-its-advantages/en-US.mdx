# What does `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` do?

`* { box-sizing: border-box; }` is a CSS rule that applies the `box-sizing: border-box` property to every element on a webpage, overriding the default `content-box` model. This changes how the `width` and `height` of elements are calculated, making the box model more predictable and intuitive by including `padding` and `border` in the specified dimensions.

## Understanding the Box Model

The CSS box model defines how elements are rendered in terms of their dimensions and spacing. Every element is a rectangular box composed of:

- **Content**: The actual content (text, images, etc.).
- **Padding**: The space between the content and the border.
- **Border**: The area surrounding the padding.
- **Margin**: The space outside the border, separating the element from others.

The `box-sizing` property determines which parts of the box model contribute to an element’s `width` and `height`.

### Default Behavior: `box-sizing: content-box`

With `content-box` (the default), the `width` and `height` properties only account for the content area. Any `padding` or `border` added to the element increases its total size beyond the specified `width` or `height`. For example:

```css
div {
  box-sizing: content-box;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}
```

- **Content size**: 100px × 100px
- **Total size**: 100px (content) + 10px (left padding) + 10px (right padding) + 5px (left border) + 5px (right border) = **130px wide**. Similarly, **130px tall**.

This can lead to unexpected layout issues, as the element’s total size exceeds the specified dimensions.

### `box-sizing: border-box`

With `border-box`, the `width` and `height` properties include the content, `padding`, and `border`. The content area shrinks to accommodate `padding` and `border` within the specified dimensions. Using the same example:

```css
div {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}
```

- **Total size**: 100px × 100px
- **Content size**: 100px - 10px (left padding) - 10px (right padding) - 5px (left border) - 5px (right border) = **70px wide**. Similarly, **70px tall**.

The `margin` is **not** included in the `width` or `height` calculation for either `box-sizing` value.

### Comparison Table

| Property  | `box-sizing: content-box` (default) | `box-sizing: border-box` |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Content   | Included                            | Included                 |
| Padding   | Excluded                            | Included                 |
| Border    | Excluded                            | Included                 |
| Margin    | Excluded                            | Excluded                 |

## Advantages of `box-sizing: border-box`

1. **Intuitive Sizing**: Designers often think of an element’s size holistically, including its padding and border. `border-box` aligns with this mental model, making it easier to create layouts where elements fit within predefined grid systems or containers.

2. **Simplified Layout Calculations**: With `border-box`, you don’t need to manually subtract padding and border values to calculate the content size. This reduces errors in responsive designs and complex layouts.

3. **Consistency Across Elements**: Applying `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` globally ensures all elements (e.g., divs, inputs, images) behave consistently, preventing unexpected size increases when styling forms, buttons, or other components with padding or borders.

4. **Better Integration with CSS Frameworks**: Popular frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS use `border-box` by default to streamline development and ensure predictable layouts.

5. **Easier Responsive Design**: In responsive layouts, where percentages or viewport units (e.g., `vw`, `vh`) are used, `border-box` prevents elements from overflowing their containers due to added padding or borders.

6. **Improved Form Styling**: Form elements like `input` and `select` often have browser-specific padding and borders. `border-box` ensures consistent sizing across browsers, making it easier to align form fields in a layout.

## Practical Example

Consider a layout with three columns, each intended to be 33.33% wide within a 900px container:

```css
.container {
  width: 900px;
  display: flex;
}

.column {
  width: 33.33%;
  padding: 15px;
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

- **With `content-box`**: Each column’s total width becomes 33.33% + 15px (left padding) + 15px (right padding) + 2px (left border) + 2px (right border). This exceeds 33.33%, causing the columns to overflow or wrap unexpectedly.
- **With `border-box`**: Each column’s total width remains 33.33% (approximately 300px in a 900px container), with padding and borders fitting within that size. The content area adjusts to accommodate these additions.

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This ensures the columns fit perfectly within the container without manual recalculations.

## Additional Considerations

### Performance Implications

Using `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` has negligible performance impact, as it’s a simple CSS property applied during rendering. However, the universal selector (`*`) can be slightly less performant in very large DOM trees due to its broad application. For optimization, you can apply `box-sizing: border-box` to specific elements or use a more targeted selector like:

```css
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

This approach sets `border-box` as the default for all elements but allows specific elements to inherit or override it (e.g., revert to `content-box` if needed).

### Browser Support

The `box-sizing` property is universally supported across all modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 8+. No vendor prefixes are required, making it safe for production use.

### Edge Cases and Gotchas

1. **Legacy Browser Issues**: While rare, older browsers like IE6-7 may not support `box-sizing`. If supporting these browsers is necessary, test layouts thoroughly or use fallbacks.
2. **Third-Party Components**: Some third-party libraries or widgets may assume `content-box`. Applying `border-box` globally could break their styling, requiring overrides.
3. **Flexbox and Grid**: In modern layouts using Flexbox or CSS Grid, `border-box` simplifies alignment by ensuring elements respect their container’s constraints without unexpected overflows.
4. **Percentage-Based Padding**: When padding is defined in percentages, it’s calculated relative to the element’s width (even for vertical padding). With `border-box`, this can reduce the content area more than expected, so test carefully.

## When to Use `content-box`

While `border-box` is generally preferred, `content-box` may be useful in specific scenarios:

- **Precise Content Sizing**: When you need the content area to be exactly the specified `width` or `height`, regardless of padding or borders (e.g., for image galleries or canvas elements).
- **Legacy Codebases**: If a project was built with `content-box` assumptions, switching to `border-box` globally could break existing layouts.

## Best Practices

1. **Apply Globally Early**: Set `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` at the start of your CSS to ensure consistency across your project.
2. **Use Resets or Normalize.css**: Many CSS resets (e.g., Normalize.css) include `border-box` by default. Verify your reset to avoid conflicts.
3. **Test with Dynamic Content**: Ensure `border-box` works as expected with dynamically sized elements, such as those using `min-width`, `max-width`, or percentage-based dimensions.
4. **Document Overrides**: If you need to use `content-box` for specific elements, document the reason clearly to avoid confusion for other developers.
