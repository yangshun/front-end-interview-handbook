title: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Ajax?
---

## Advantages

- Better interactivity. New content from the server can be changed dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.
- Reduce connections to the server since scripts and stylesheets only have to be requested once.
- State can be maintained on a page. JavaScript variables and DOM state will persist because the main container page was not reloaded.
- Basically most of the advantages of an SPA.

## Disadvantages

- Dynamic webpages are harder to bookmark.
- Does not work if JavaScript has been disabled in the browser.
- Some web crawlers do not execute JavaScript and would not see content that has been loaded by JavaScript.
- Webpages using Ajax to fetch data will likely have to combine the fetched remote data with client-side templates to update the DOM. For this to happen, JavaScript will have to be parsed and executed on the browser, and low-end mobile devices might struggle with this.
- Basically most of the disadvantages of an SPA.
