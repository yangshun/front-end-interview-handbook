title: What are the pros and cons of using Promises instead of callbacks?
---

## Pros

- Avoid callback hell which can be unreadable.
- Makes it easy to write sequential asynchronous code that is readable with `.then()`.
- Makes it easy to write parallel asynchronous code with `Promise.all()`.
- With promises, these scenarios which are present in callbacks-only coding, will not happen:
  - Call the callback too early
  - Call the callback too late (or never)
  - Call the callback too few or too many times
  - Fail to pass along any necessary environment/parameters
  - Swallow any errors/exceptions that may happen

## Cons

- Slightly more complex code (debatable).
- In older browsers where ES2015 is not supported, you need to load a polyfill in order to use it.
