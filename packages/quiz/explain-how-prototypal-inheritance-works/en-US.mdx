title: Explain how prototypal inheritance works
---

This is an extremely common JavaScript interview question. All JavaScript objects have a `__proto__` property with the exception of objects created with `Object.create(null)`, that is a reference to another object, which is called the object's "prototype". When a property is accessed on an object and if the property is not found on that object, the JavaScript engine looks at the object's `__proto__`, and the `__proto__`'s `__proto__` and so on, until it finds the property defined on one of the `__proto__`s or until it reaches the end of the prototype chain. This behavior simulates classical inheritance, but it is really more of [delegation than inheritance](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-objects).

## Example of Prototypal Inheritance

```js
function Parent() {
  this.name = 'Parent';
}

Parent.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log('Hello from ' + this.name);
};

const child = Object.create(Parent.prototype);

// Call parent constructor with child
Parent.call(child);

child.cry = function () {
  console.log('waaaaaahhhh!');
};

child.cry();
// waaaaaahhhh!

child.greet();
// hello from Parent

child.constructor;
// ƒ Parent() {
//   this.name = 'Parent';
// }

child.constructor.name;
// 'Parent'
```

Things to note are:

- `.greet` is not defined on the _child_, so the engine goes up the prototype chain and finds `.greet` off the inherited from _Parent_.
- We need to call `Object.create` in one of following ways for the prototype methods to be inherited:
  - Object.create(Parent.prototype);
  - Object.create(new Parent(null));
  - Object.create(objLiteral);
  - Currently, `child.constructor` is pointing to the `Parent`:

If we'd like to correct this, one option would be to do:

```js
function Parent() {
  this.name = 'Parent';
}

Parent.prototype.greet = function () {
  console.log('Hello from ' + this.name);
};

function Child() {
  Parent.call(this);
  this.name = 'Child';
}

Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype);
Child.prototype.constructor = Child;

const child = new Child();

child.greet();
// hello from Child

child.constructor.name;
// 'Child'
```
