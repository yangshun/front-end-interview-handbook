## Techniques

- Graceful degradation: The practice of building an application for modern browsers while ensuring it remains functional in older browsers.
- Progressive enhancement: The practice of building an application for a base level of user experience, but adding functional enhancements when a browser supports it.
- Use [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) to check for feature support.
- Autoprefixer for automatic vendor prefix insertion.
- Feature detection using [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/).
- Use CSS Feature queries via [`@support``](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports)
