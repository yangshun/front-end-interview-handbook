        Preparing for my first rounds of tech interviews was really daunting - I
        wasn't sure what to expect and where to start. This handbook together

          Tech Interview Handbook

        was a great starting point for me. It clearly describes each part of the
        process and has tons of awesome tips and resources. With this handbook
        and lots of practice, I managed to get offers from Facebook, Dropbox and
        Amazon!

        There aren't a lot of high quality front end interview prep materials
        online. That's why the Front End Interview Handbook is my go-to prep
        resource. With the help of the interview handbook, I was able to easily
        identify my weak points and work on them. As a result, I managed to get
        offers from Meta, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft, Coinbase, etc.

        Before discovering the handbook, I didn't know what to expect for my
        front end interviews. Thanks to it, I had a better understanding and
        even learned new things about frontend development. The handbook is an
        immense resource, one that I still use to refresh and reinforce my
        knowledge to tackle interviews confidently!
